# Miscellaneous Experiments
**One-off Scripts and Uncategorized Projects**

## What This Folder Contains
Random experiments, test scripts, and projects that don't fit into other categories. These are typically one-off tools, quick experiments, or files that haven't been organized into proper projects yet.

## Current Contents

### focus_list.jsonl
- Large file (89MB) containing prioritized items from various analyses
- Likely output from CogRepo or similar analysis tool
- Contains high-priority conversations, insights, or action items

### strategic_projects.json
- Synthesized strategic insights and project opportunities
- Likely generated from conversation analysis
- Contains structured data about potential projects and initiatives

### MCP Headquarters :.webloc
- Bookmark/link file
- Reference to MCP (Model Context Protocol) resources
- Part of the AI/LLM tooling ecosystem

## Purpose of This Folder
- **Staging Area**: For new scripts before they become full projects
- **Archive**: For completed one-off tasks that might be useful later
- **Testing Ground**: For experimenting with new ideas
- **Reference Files**: Links and resources that don't belong elsewhere

## Organization Philosophy
Files here should either:
1. Graduate to their own project folder once they mature
2. Be deleted if they're no longer useful
3. Stay here if they're genuinely miscellaneous utilities
