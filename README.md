# RR Coding Experiments
**A Collection of Creative Technology Projects**

## Overview
This repository contains various coding projects and experiments, ranging from creative file management systems to data analysis pipelines and retro game development. Each project solves real-world problems or explores interesting technical challenges.

## Projects

### üé¨ [8BG Renaming Tools](./8bg-renaming-tools/)
A universal file naming system for creative projects. Originally developed for film production, now applicable to any collaborative creative work. Solves the chaos of version control in creative industries.

### üè¢ [MM Area + Sub-Area Taxonomy](./active-projects/MM%20--%20Area%20+%20Sub-Area%20Taxonomy/)
Modern Magic's canonical 8-area organizational taxonomy with lifecycle phases. Features GitHub‚ÜíNotion sync, stable IDs, and clear DRI assignments for project lifecycle management.

### üß† [CogRepo](./active-projects/cogrepo/)
Transform LLM conversations into a searchable knowledge base. Captures, indexes, and analyzes AI chat history to extract insights, patterns, and strategic opportunities from thousands of conversations.

### ‚úàÔ∏è [Family Travel Analysis](./family-travel-analysis/)
Data mining pipeline for analyzing years of family travel conversations. Extracts patterns, preferences, and planning insights from chat history to understand travel dynamics and improve future trip planning.

### üéå [Anime Directors Analysis](./anime-directors-analysis/)
Analyzes conversations about legendary animation directors like Miyazaki and Satoshi Kon. Tracks discussion patterns, film references, and thematic connections across 308+ conversations about anime.

### üßü [Zombie Quest](./zombie-quest/)
A retro Sierra-style adventure game built in Python with Pygame. Features authentic VGA palette and classic point-and-click gameplay, combining nostalgia with modern zombie themes.

### üîß [Miscellaneous Experiments](./misc-experiments/)
One-off scripts and uncategorized utilities. The staging ground for new ideas and quick experiments that haven't evolved into full projects yet.

## Common Themes
- **Data Analysis**: Mining insights from conversation history
- **Creative Tools**: Systems for creative professionals
- **Pattern Recognition**: Finding hidden insights in large datasets
- **Nostalgia Tech**: Recreating classic computing experiences
- **Real-World Solutions**: Tools built to solve actual problems

## Technical Stack
- **Languages**: Python, Bash
- **Data Formats**: JSON, JSONL, Parquet
- **Libraries**: Pygame, pandas, various Python standard libs
- **Web**: HTML/CSS/JS for UI components

## Philosophy
These projects represent a belief that:
- Conversations and creative work are too valuable to lose
- Organization systems can enhance creativity, not restrict it
- Data analysis can reveal insights about ourselves
- Technology should solve real problems, not create them
- Sometimes the best solution is a simple script

## Getting Started
Each project has its own README with specific setup instructions. Most Python projects use standard pip-installable requirements. Shell scripts are generally standalone and ready to run.

## Future Direction
- More integration between projects (e.g., using CogRepo to analyze creative project discussions)
- Web interfaces for command-line tools
- Machine learning applications for pattern recognition
- API development for tool accessibility
