Blue Bottle Coffee (Playa Vista Brickyard),Playa Vista,Ambiguous wifi/outlet experience and quick‑turnover design.,"Some sources mention wifi and floor outlets, but brand‑wide inconsistency and quick‑turnover layout keep it out of a rigorously reliable worklist.",Verified Open (Borderline; Excluded)
"The Conservatory for Coffee, Tea & Cocoa",Culver City,Explicit no‑wifi policy.,"Multiple sources describe it as a deliberate ""no wifi"" zone meant for conversation, so it fails the basic infrastructure bar.",Verified Open (No Wifi)
