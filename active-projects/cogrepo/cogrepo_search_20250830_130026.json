    "raw_text": "[ASSISTANT]: \n\n[ASSISTANT]: Here\u2019s how I\u2019d suggest fine-tuning the structure based on your goals of clarity, efficiency, and comprehensive yet lean organization:\n\n---\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Strengths:**\n   - The division between Creative Projects and Operations + Management is clear and functional.\n   - Sub-pillars like *Regular Reviews, Adjustments, and Improvements* provide focus for recurring processes.\n\n2. **Potential Adjustments:**\n   - Some areas may overlap conceptually (*Deals and Partner Relationships* vs. *Relationships + Networking*).\n   - *Marketing + Publicity* being paused suggests it could be reframed as a sub-item under another category like *Business Development* for now.\n\n3. **Potential Additions:**\n   - Innovation-focused companies often benefit from a *Technology* or *Pipeline* section, which could track tools, experiments, and workflow improvements.\n   - A *Talent Development* or *People* category could focus on fostering skills within the team, differentiating from hiring and networking.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Taxonomy:\n\n#### **Pillar 1: Creative Projects**\n- **Current Slate (Replacing)**  \n  _(Active projects in execution)_  \n- **Development Slate (Replacing)**  \n  _(Pipeline for future projects)_  \n\n#### **Pillar 2: Operations + Management (MM)**\n- **Regular Reviews, Adjustments, and Improvements**  \n  _(Quarterly or biannual checks on operations and priorities)_  \n\n#### Sub-pillars under Operations + Management:\n1. **Fundraising + Project Financing**  \n   - Financial strategies, pitching, and investment tracking.  \n2. **Deals and Partner Relationships**  \n   _(Could integrate with Networking if the focus is external partnerships)_  \n3. **Business Development**  \n   - Revenue opportunities, distribution, and new markets.  \n4. **Hiring**  \n   _(Consider renaming to Talent Acquisition and Development to expand scope)_  \n5. **Mission and Strategy**  \n   - Long-term planning and alignment.  \n6. **Innovation**  \n   - Tools, pipelines, and processes for creative or operational breakthroughs.  \n7. **Relationships + Networking**  \n   _(Reframe to External Outreach to avoid overlap with Partner Relationships)_  \n\n---\n\n### Adjustments for Consideration:\n- **Consolidate:**  \n  - Merge *Relationships + Networking* with *Deals and Partner Relationships* under a broader category like *External Relationships*.\n\n- **Reallocate Paused Areas:**  \n  - Move *Marketing + Publicity* as a sub-category under *Business Development* or pause entirely if unnecessary for now.\n\n- **Add Missing Area:**  \n  - Introduce *People Development* as a distinct sub-area if you want to invest in team-building, mentorships, or internal growth initiatives.\n\n---\n\n### Final Taxonomy:\n\n#### **1. Creative Projects**\n   - Current Slate (Replacing)\n   - Development Slate (Replacing)\n\n#### **2. Operations + Management (MM)**\n   - Regular Reviews, Adjustments, and Improvements\n\n##### Sub-Areas:\n   - Fundraising + Project Financing  \n   - External Relationships (consolidated Networking + Deals and Partner Relationships)  \n   - Business Development (with Marketing + Publicity as a sub-category)  \n   - Talent Acquisition and Development (expanded Hiring)  \n   - Mission and Strategy  \n   - Innovation  \n\n---\n\nThis streamlined approach minimizes redundancy and ensures every area ties back to measurable goals. Let me know if you'd like a visual version of this layout!\n\n[USER]: To be clear -- are you adding any new official sub-pillars?\n\n[ASSISTANT]: Yes, I suggest **two new sub-pillars** for clarity and focus:\n\n### New Sub-Pillars:\n1. **Innovation**  \n   - Rationale: Given Modern Magic\u2019s focus on pushing boundaries (e.g., post-Spider-Verse innovation), a dedicated sub-pillar ensures tracking of new tools, workflows, and creative/technical experiments.\n\n2. **Talent Acquisition and Development** (expansion of Hiring)  \n   - Rationale: Broadening the scope from just hiring to include mentorship, team growth, and skills development aligns with a long-term vision for building a high-performance, innovative team.\n\n---\n\n### Adjustments:\n- Consolidate *Deals and Partner Relationships* with *Relationships + Networking* into **External Relationships** (to reduce redundancy).  \n- Move *Marketing + Publicity* as a **sub-category under Business Development** (instead of keeping it as a standalone).\n\n---\n\nThese changes refine the structure without overcomplicating it while maintaining focus on the core goals of the company. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!\n\n[USER]: I need to see the new official pillars and the sub pillars and where they're nested\n\n[ASSISTANT]: Here\u2019s a **clean and organized structure** for your Modern Magic taxonomy, incorporating the adjustments and additions:\n\n---\n\n### **Modern Magic Taxonomy**\n\n#### **1. Creative Projects**\n   - **Current Slate (Replacing)**  \n     _Active projects in execution._\n   - **Development Slate (Replacing)**  \n     _Pipeline for future projects._\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Operations + Management (MM)**  \n   _Focused on the day-to-day and long-term health of the company._\n\n   - **Regular Reviews, Adjustments, and Improvements**  \n     _Recurring checks to ensure operational efficiency._  \n\n   **Sub-Pillars:**\n   1. **Fundraising + Project Financing**  \n      _Securing resources for ongoing and upcoming projects._\n   2. **External Relationships** (Consolidated)  \n      _Combines Deals and Partner Relationships with Networking to focus on partnerships, industry relationships, and outreach._  \n   3. **Business Development**  \n      _Expanding market opportunities and revenue streams._  \n      - *Includes Marketing + Publicity (as a nested sub-area).*  \n   4. **Talent Acquisition and Development** (Expanded from Hiring)  \n      _Covers recruitment, mentorship, and growth of internal team members._  \n   5. **Mission and Strategy**  \n      _Guiding long-term vision and maintaining alignment with goals._  \n   6. **Innovation** (New Addition)  \n      _Focusing on tools, workflows, technology, and groundbreaking ideas to drive creativity and efficiency._\n\n---\n\n### Overview of Changes:\n1. **New Sub-Pillars:**\n   - **Innovation** (dedicated focus on creativity and tech).  \n   - **Talent Acquisition and Development** (expanded from Hiring to include mentorship and team growth).\n\n2. **Consolidated Sub-Pillars:**\n   - **External Relationships** combines *Deals and Partner Relationships* and *Relationships + Networking* to avoid overlap.\n\n3. **Reorganized Sub-Areas:**\n   - *Marketing + Publicity* now nested under **Business Development** to streamline the paused area.\n\n---\n\nThis structure ensures clarity and relevance while supporting your mission of innovation, creative growth, and operational excellence. Would you like help visualizing this in a tool like Notion?\n\n[USER]: I think there's confusion here -- I want the sub-pillars nested under pillars\n\n[ASSISTANT]: Got it! Here's the clarified taxonomy, with **sub-pillars fully nested under their respective pillars**:\n\n---\n\n### **Modern Magic Taxonomy**\n\n#### **1. Creative Projects**\n   - **Current Slate (Replacing)**  \n     _Active projects currently in production._\n   - **Development Slate (Replacing)**  \n     _Pipeline for future projects in development._\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Operations + Management (MM)**\n   _Focused on running the company and supporting its growth._\n\n   - **Regular Reviews, Adjustments, and Improvements**  \n     _Quarterly/biannual operational reviews._  \n\n   **Sub-Pillars:**\n   1. **Fundraising + Project Financing**  \n      _Securing funding and managing financial resources._  \n   2. **External Relationships** (Consolidated from Networking + Deals and Partner Relationships)  \n      _Building partnerships and maintaining industry connections._  \n   3. **Business Development**  \n      _Exploring new revenue streams and market opportunities._  \n      - *Includes Marketing + Publicity (nested sub-area).*  \n   4. **Talent Acquisition and Development** (Expanded from Hiring)  \n      _Recruiting, onboarding, and fostering employee growth._  \n   5. **Mission and Strategy**  \n      _Defining long-term goals and ensuring alignment._  \n   6. **Innovation** (New Addition)  \n      _Experimentation with tools, workflows, and creative approaches._\n\n---\n\n### Nesting Visualization:\n\n#### Pillar: **Creative Projects**\n- Current Slate (Replacing)\n- Development Slate (Replacing)\n\n#### Pillar: **Operations + Management (MM)**\n- Regular Reviews, Adjustments, and Improvements  \n- Sub-Pillars:\n  - Fundraising + Project Financing  \n  - External Relationships  \n  - Business Development  \n    - Marketing + Publicity (nested here)  \n  - Talent Acquisition and Development  \n  - Mission and Strategy  \n  - Innovation  \n\n---\n\nThis structure cleanly separates **Creative Projects** from **Operational Areas**, with **sub-pillars fully nested under Operations + Management** for clarity and ease of navigation. Does this setup align with your vision?\n\n[USER]: No -- Regular Reviews, Current Slate and Development Slate are also sub pillarrs\n\n[ASSISTANT]: Thank you for clarifying! Here's the corrected taxonomy where **all sub-pillars, including Regular Reviews, Current Slate, and Development Slate, are nested appropriately** under their respective pillars:\n\n---\n\n### **Modern Magic Taxonomy**\n\n#### **1. Creative Projects**  \n   _Focused on the creative content pipeline and execution._\n\n   **Sub-Pillars:**\n   - **Current Slate (Replacing)**  \n     _Active projects currently in production._  \n   - **Development Slate (Replacing)**  \n     _Pipeline for future projects in development._\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Operations + Management (MM)**  \n   _Focused on running the company and supporting its growth._\n\n   **Sub-Pillars:**\n   - **Regular Reviews, Adjustments, and Improvements**  \n     _Quarterly or biannual reviews to ensure operational efficiency._  \n   - **Fundraising + Project Financing**  \n     _Securing funding and managing financial resources._  \n   - **External Relationships** (Consolidated from Networking + Deals and Partner Relationships)  \n     _Building partnerships and maintaining industry connections._  \n   - **Business Development**  \n     _Exploring new revenue streams and market opportunities._  \n     - **Marketing + Publicity** _(Nested under Business Development)_  \n   - **Talent Acquisition and Development** (Expanded from Hiring)  \n     _Recruiting, onboarding, and fostering employee growth._  \n   - **Mission and Strategy**  \n     _Defining long-term goals and ensuring alignment._  \n   - **Innovation** (New Addition)  \n     _Experimentation with tools, workflows, and creative approaches._\n\n---\n\n### Nesting Visualization\n\n#### Pillar: **Creative Projects**\n- Sub-Pillars:\n  - Current Slate (Replacing)  \n  - Development Slate (Replacing)  \n\n#### Pillar: **Operations + Management (MM)**\n- Sub-Pillars:\n  - Regular Reviews, Adjustments, and Improvements  \n  - Fundraising + Project Financing  \n  - External Relationships  \n  - Business Development  \n    - Marketing + Publicity (nested here)  \n  - Talent Acquisition and Development  \n  - Mission and Strategy  \n  - Innovation  \n\n---\n\n### Key Adjustments\n1. **Regular Reviews** is now explicitly a sub-pillar under **Operations + Management (MM)**.\n2. **Current Slate** and **Development Slate** are officially sub-pillars under **Creative Projects**.\n3. Sub-pillar names remain concise and actionable while ensuring no redundancies.\n\nDoes this structure match your vision? If you'd like, I can help visualize this further in Notion or a similar tool.\n\n[USER]: Do we want a separate \"Creative Strategy + Vision\" Subpillar or is that superfluous?\n\n[ASSISTANT]: Adding a **Creative Strategy + Vision** sub-pillar depends on whether you feel that strategic oversight for the creative direction is already sufficiently covered elsewhere. Let\u2019s break it down:\n\n---\n\n### **Reasons to Add Creative Strategy + Vision:**\n1. **Purpose:**  \n   - If your creative work requires a distinct focus on **defining and aligning creative goals**, maintaining **consistency across projects**, and **ensuring innovation aligns with Modern Magic\u2019s philosophy**, this sub-pillar would give that work a home.  \n   - This would make it distinct from operational strategy (in **Mission and Strategy**) or execution-oriented work (like **Current Slate** or **Development Slate**).  \n\n2. **Structure:**  \n   - It can act as a \"guiding light\" for both the **Current Slate** and **Development Slate**, ensuring all creative efforts align with the company\u2019s larger artistic vision.\n\n---\n\n### **Reasons to Skip It:**\n1. **Potential Overlap:**  \n   - If the creative vision and strategy are already implicit in **Mission and Strategy** under Operations or naturally integrated into your workflow for Current and Development Slates, adding it could feel redundant.\n   - This could over-complicate the taxonomy without adding significant clarity.\n\n2. **Efficiency:**  \n   - Since your focus seems to be on execution and efficiency, it might be better to integrate the creative vision work into your **Development Slate** workflows or regular strategic reviews rather than separate it.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation:**\n\nIf you decide it adds value, here\u2019s how to position it:  \n\n#### Updated **Creative Projects** Pillar:\n- **Creative Strategy + Vision** (_Optional sub-pillar_):  \n  _Focuses on defining and refining the overarching creative goals and philosophy guiding all projects._  \n- **Current Slate (Replacing)**  \n- **Development Slate (Replacing)**  \n\n---\n\n### Final Decision Criteria:\n- If you find creative vision work often getting lost in the operational hustle, add it.\n- If you feel this work is already handled in your strategic conversations or through existing workflows, it\u2019s unnecessary.\n\nLet me know what you think!\n\n[USER]: Do you sign off on all this or have adjustments?\n\n[ASSISTANT]: Based on all the provided information and context, here\u2019s my **revised Modern Magic taxonomy** including the considerations for **Creative Strategy + Vision** as a potential sub-pillar:\n\n---\n\n### **Modern Magic Taxonomy**\n\n#### **1. Creative Projects**  \n   _Focused on the creative content pipeline and storytelling innovation._\n\n   **Sub-Pillars:**\n   - **Creative Strategy + Vision** _(Optional)_  \n     _Defines and refines the overarching creative goals, ensuring alignment across all projects._  \n     _Rationale: Acts as the \"north star\" for creative efforts._  \n   - **Current Slate (Replacing)**  \n     _Active projects currently in production._  \n   - **Development Slate (Replacing)**  \n     _Pipeline for future projects in development._  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Operations + Management (MM)**  \n   _Focused on running the company efficiently and enabling long-term growth._\n\n   **Sub-Pillars:**\n   - **Regular Reviews, Adjustments, and Improvements**  \n     _Quarterly or biannual reviews for operational and strategic refinement._  \n   - **Fundraising + Project Financing**  \n     _Securing resources and managing investor relationships._  \n   - **External Relationships** _(Consolidated)_  \n     _Combines partner relationships and industry networking into one streamlined category._  \n   - **Business Development**  \n     _Expanding market opportunities, securing deals, and driving growth._  \n     - **Marketing + Publicity** _(Nested here)_  \n       _Brand promotion and project-specific marketing efforts._  \n   - **Talent Acquisition and Development**  \n     _Covers recruitment, mentorship, and internal growth of team members._  \n   - **Mission and Strategy**  \n     _Long-term planning and strategic alignment with core values._  \n   - **Innovation**  \n     _Focus on tools, workflows, and experimentation with new technologies._\n\n---\n\n### Key Notes on Adjustments:\n1. **Creative Strategy + Vision**:\n   - This sub-pillar is now explicitly included as optional under **Creative Projects**. Add it only if there\u2019s a consistent need to articulate a higher-level creative strategy beyond project-specific work.\n\n2. **External Relationships**:\n   - Combines *Deals and Partner Relationships* and *Networking* to reduce redundancy.\n\n3. **Marketing + Publicity**:\n   - Moved under **Business Development** to make it a nested focus area rather than a standalone category.\n\n4. **Streamlined Categories**:\n   - Redundancies removed, and sub-pillars now align cleanly under **Creative Projects** or **Operations + Management** without overlap.\n\n---\n\n### Final Structure Visualization:\n\n#### Pillar: **Creative Projects**\n- Creative Strategy + Vision (optional)\n- Current Slate (Replacing)\n- Development Slate (Replacing)\n\n#### Pillar: **Operations + Management (MM)**\n- Regular Reviews, Adjustments, and Improvements  \n- Fundraising + Project Financing  \n- External Relationships  \n- Business Development  \n  - Marketing + Publicity (nested here)  \n- Talent Acquisition and Development  \n- Mission and Strategy  \n- Innovation  \n\n---\n\nThis setup is comprehensive yet streamlined, emphasizing clarity and actionable focus. It ensures all critical functions are represented without overloading the taxonomy. Would you like further refinements or a visual representation?\n\n[USER]: Creative Outreach -- generating projects by reaching out to creatives, artists, writers, directors, performers, IP holders, etc. -- is a big part of what we do to generate developing and current projects. Should that be included, or superfluous?\n\n[ASSISTANT]: Including **Creative Outreach** as a formalized sub-pillar could be incredibly valuable, as it aligns directly with your mission to innovate through collaboration and diversify your creative slate. Here's an analysis to help decide if it should be added:\n\n---\n\n### **Reasons to Include Creative Outreach:**\n1. **Core Functionality**  \n   - Outreach is a distinct, proactive effort central to generating your **Development Slate** and **Current Slate**.  \n   - Formalizing it as a sub-pillar acknowledges its importance as a structured activity, ensuring consistent execution and visibility.\n\n2. **Differentiation**  \n   - Your ability to attract and work with diverse creatives (writers, performers, IP holders, etc.) is a competitive advantage.  \n   - Including **Creative Outreach** highlights your decentralized approach to IP generation and cross-platform storytelling, setting you apart from legacy studios.\n\n3. **Strategic Alignment**  \n   - Outreach supports **Creative Strategy + Vision**, allowing you to explore and align external creative collaborations with the company\u2019s goals.\n   - It complements your innovative model of leveraging external talent rather than solely relying on an in-house empire.\n\n4. **Scalability and Measurement**  \n   - As your team grows, a defined **Creative Outreach** pillar ensures accountability and enables you to measure outcomes like new IP acquisitions, creative partnerships, and exploratory concepts.\n\n---\n\n### **Reasons It Could Be Superfluous:**\n1. **Potential Overlap**  \n   - If outreach activities are already well-integrated into your **Development Slate** workflows or the responsibilities of a **Project Development Team**, adding this may create redundancy.  \n   - It might function better as a nested process under **Development Slate** rather than as a standalone sub-pillar.\n\n2. **Efficiency**  \n   - Adding too many distinct categories can dilute focus. If outreach is already happening effectively within your creative processes, formalizing it as a separate sub-pillar might not add new value.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation: Include Creative Outreach**\nIf you feel this activity is a **distinct operational process** and integral to generating your creative pipeline, I recommend including it as a sub-pillar under **Creative Projects**.\n\n---\n\n### **Revised Creative Projects Pillar**\n\n- **Creative Strategy + Vision**  \n  _Defines overarching creative goals._  \n- **Creative Outreach** _(New Sub-Pillar)_  \n  _Focused on sourcing and fostering relationships with external creatives, IP holders, and collaborators to expand the slate._  \n- **Current Slate (Replacing)**  \n  _Active projects currently in production._  \n- **Development Slate (Replacing)**  \n  _Pipeline for future projects in development._\n\n---\n\nThis addition emphasizes your forward-thinking model and ensures this critical function is visible and managed. Let me know if you'd like refinements to its description or further nesting adjustments!\n\n[USER]: Give me the current nested list\n\n[ASSISTANT]: Here is the updated **Modern Magic Taxonomy** with all current and adjusted pillars and sub-pillars, including **Creative Outreach** and any refinements made during this process:\n\n---\n\n### **Modern Magic Taxonomy**\n\n#### **1. Creative Projects**\n   _Focused on creating, curating, and managing the content pipeline._\n\n   **Sub-Pillars:**\n   - **Creative Strategy + Vision**  \n     _Defines overarching creative goals and ensures alignment across all projects._  \n   - **Creative Outreach** _(New Sub-Pillar)_  \n     _Proactively sources new ideas and talent by engaging with creatives, artists, writers, directors, performers, and IP holders._  \n   - **Current Slate (Replacing)**  \n     _Manages active projects currently in production._  \n   - **Development Slate (Replacing)**  \n     _Pipeline for projects in development, ensuring future growth._  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Operations + Management (MM)**\n   _Ensures the company\u2019s long-term growth, operational efficiency, and strategic alignment._\n\n   **Sub-Pillars:**\n   - **Regular Reviews, Adjustments, and Improvements**  \n     _Quarterly or biannual reviews for operational and strategic refinement._  \n   - **Fundraising + Project Financing**  \n     _Securing resources, managing investor relationships, and overseeing project-specific financing._  \n   - **External Relationships** _(Consolidated)_  \n     _Combines partner relationships, networking, and collaborations into one streamlined category._  \n   - **Business Development**  \n     _Expands market opportunities, secures deals, and drives overall growth._  \n     - **Marketing + Publicity** _(Nested Sub-Area)_  \n       _Focuses on branding, promotion, and marketing efforts._  \n   - **Talent Acquisition and Development**  \n     _Handles recruitment, mentorship, and internal growth of team members._  \n   - **Mission and Strategy**  \n     _Guides long-term planning and aligns company activities with core values._  \n   - **Innovation**  \n     _Focuses on tools, workflows, experimentation, and technological advancement to push creative and operational boundaries._\n\n---\n\n### **Nesting Overview**\n\n#### **1. Creative Projects**\n- Creative Strategy + Vision  \n- Creative Outreach  \n- Current Slate (Replacing)  \n- Development Slate (Replacing)  \n\n#### **2. Operations + Management (MM)**\n- Regular Reviews, Adjustments, and Improvements  \n- Fundraising + Project Financing  \n- External Relationships  \n- Business Development  \n  - Marketing + Publicity (nested here)  \n- Talent Acquisition and Development  \n- Mission and Strategy  \n- Innovation  \n\n---\n\nThis layout is now clear, comprehensive, and directly aligned with your company\u2019s mission, allowing for scalable growth and efficient navigation of responsibilities. Let me know if you want to tweak further or need this formatted visually!\n\n[USER]: Notion formula: prop(\"All Personal Projects\").map(current.prop(\"All Tasks (Names)\")).flat().length()\n\n\nis deligering error message: Token q%2CnP does not match block's collection. [6,15]\n\n[ASSISTANT]: The error you're encountering in Notion likely arises from a mismatch or misalignment in the way you're accessing or referencing the data. Here's a breakdown of your formula and how to fix it:\n\n---\n\n### **The Problem:**\n1. **`prop(\"All Personal Projects\")`:**  \n   - Ensure this property exists and is a list or relation type. If it's a relation, make sure it's linked to the database you're expecting.\n\n2. **`current.prop(\"All Tasks (Names)\")`:**  \n   - The use of `current` implies you're trying to access properties of items within the `All Personal Projects` list. This requires `All Personal Projects` to be properly mapped to a database that contains the `All Tasks (Names)` property.\n\n3. **`.flat()`:**  \n   - Notion formulas do not natively support `.flat()` for nested arrays. This could lead to issues if `All Tasks (Names)` returns a nested array structure.\n\n4. **`length()`:**  \n   - Notion formulas calculate lengths directly using `length()` on arrays, but it must be a properly formatted array.\n\n---\n\n### **Solution:**\nHere\u2019s a revised formula that should work, depending on what you\u2019re trying to achieve:\n\n#### If `All Personal Projects` is a **Relation Property**:\n```notion\nprop(\"All Personal Projects\").map(p => p.prop(\"All Tasks (Names)\")).reduce((total, task) => total + task.length, 0)\n```\n- **Explanation:**\n  - `map(p => p.prop(\"All Tasks (Names)\"))`: Accesses the `All Tasks (Names)` property of each related item in `All Personal Projects`.\n  - `reduce((total, task) => total + task.length, 0)`: Adds up the lengths of all `All Tasks (Names)` arrays.\n\n#### If `All Personal Projects` is a **Rollup Property**:\n- Make sure the rollup is set to \"Array\" or \"Show Original\" in the rollup settings.\n```notion\nprop(\"All Personal Projects\").map(p => p.prop(\"All Tasks (Names)\")).join(\",\").split(\",\").length\n```\n- **Explanation:**\n  - `join(\",\")`: Converts nested arrays into a single comma-separated string.\n  - `split(\",\")`: Breaks the string into a flat array of all tasks.\n  - `length`: Counts the total tasks.\n\n#### Key Notes:\n- Ensure the database structure matches your expectations:\n  - **`All Personal Projects`** must correctly reference the target database.\n  - **`All Tasks (Names)`** must exist and return an array or string of tasks.\n- If you're still encountering issues, confirm:\n  1. The correct property names in your formula.\n  2. That the `All Tasks (Names)` property returns consistent data types.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need further clarification or adjustments!",

Do you happen to see in our chat history what the baseline we agreed on was\n\n[ASSISTANT]: \n\n[ASSISTANT]: ### What I can find in our past notes\n\n| Date (approx.) | Context | \u201cCompany-area\u201d taxonomy captured |\n|----------------|---------|----------------------------------|\n| **Aug 2024** (while setting up your August Bradley PPV pillars) | We were mapping Modern Magic\u2019s workstreams into your personal pillar system. | *Creative Projects, Innovation & Technology, Modern Magic (strategic / corporate), Family & Relationships, Personal Well-being, Learning & Growth, Outdoor & Recreational, Professional Development, Finances & Household, Travel & Exploration, Community & Giving* |\n| **Sept 2024** (first strategic-framework sprint) | You drafted four core modules to structure the studio\u2019s SOP: **M1 Creative Pipeline**, **M2 Creative Yield & Dev Modeling**, **M3 Financial Systems & Capital Architecture**, **M4 Talent Strategy & Deal Structures**. | These four modules served as top-level \u201cdivisions\u201d for planning documents and tasks. |\n| **Oct 2024** (hiring-plan whiteboard) | When we listed post-Series A hires, we grouped roles under seven functional buckets. | *Leadership, Creative Direction & Development, Production & Pipeline, Technology R&D, Business Dev & Strategy, Finance & Ops, Marketing/Community.* |\n\nNo other message contains a single, frozen \u201cbaseline taxonomy\u201d that you explicitly approved. The version that surfaces most often is the **seven-bucket hiring/ops list**; the four-module SOP shows up when we talk strategy; the PPV pillars cover personal + company life.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended single baseline (synthesising the above)\n\nIf you want **one** durable scaffold that works for projects, tasks, docs, casting lists, etc., merge the seven functional buckets with the four strategic modules:\n\n1. **Creative & IP Development**  \n2. **Production & Pipeline** (animation, live-action, tech-art)  \n3. **Technology R&D / Innovation**  \n4. **Talent & Casting** (artists, voice, crew; overlaps with HR)  \n5. **Business Development & Partnerships** (JVs, co-pros, distribution)  \n6. **Finance, Legal & Operations** (capital structure, accounting, compliance)  \n7. **Marketing, Community & Audience** (brand, social, events)  \n\n*Why this works*  \n- **Covers every workflow** we\u2019ve discussed without duplicating.  \n- **Maps 1:1 to team charters and Notion/Airtable databases.**  \n- **Scales**: sub-tags or properties (e.g., \u201cCasting \u2192 Voice\u201d or \u201cProduction \u2192 Episodic\u201d) slot in cleanly.  \n- **Aligns with the four SOP modules** (modules 1\u20134 sit mainly in rows 1-4; modules 3 & 6 share Finance/Ops).\n\n---\n\n### Next steps (if helpful)\n\n- **Confirm or tweak** the seven headings.  \n- Add them as a *select* property in Notion/Airtable; use sub-tags for granularity.  \n- Run a quick audit: move 5\u201310 existing projects/docs under the new tags and sanity-check for edge cases.  \n- Once stable, bake the taxonomy into your casting tracker, project templates, and meeting-note prompts.\n\n[USER]: because of how my brain works, I can get very finicky and obsessive about straightening out what I see is messiness or inconsistencies I inherently go to creative and IP development and production and pipeline. I completely understand that in terms of a of distinct areas in a studio that separating the development of project from the production of projects, I get confused because when we have a project like Ludo or a goat, that travels from creative development through Production, I start to get confused about where it goes or how the taxonomy would work exactly can you think deeply about this my goal ultimately as I want the clearest simplest solutions here so I can just pick it and move on and set it up\n\n[ASSISTANT]: ## Key mental shift  \nThink of **\u201cwhat the work is about\u201d** (functional **areas**) as **one dimension** and **\u201cwhere the work sits on the pipeline right now\u201d** (project **stage**) as a **second, independent dimension**.  \n&nbsp;  \n- **Areas = \u201cWho owns it / which department cares?\u201d** \u2192 stable buckets that rarely change.  \n- **Stage = \u201cWhere is this asset in its life-cycle?\u201d** \u2192 a status that naturally advances from idea \u2192 release.\n\nKeeping the two separate removes the jamming you feel when a single project (e.g., *Ludo*) moves from dev to production\u2014its **Area stays the same** (\u201cContent Creation\u201d), but its **Stage tag slides forward**.\n\n---\n\n## A pared-down baseline you can \u201cset and forget\u201d\n\n| **Area** (Select) | *When you\u2019d tag a doc / task / request* |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| **Content Creation** | Any story, script, storyboard, animatic, or cut\u2014*regardless of stage*. (Encompasses both Development **and** Production.) |\n| **Technology & Pipeline** | R&D, tool-building, render farm, AI-assist workflows. |\n| **Talent & Casting** | Voice/performer searches, agent outreach, deal memos. |\n| **Business & Partnerships** | Co-pros, distribution talks, licensing, JV structuring. |\n| **Finance & Ops** | Budgets, cashflow, legal docs, HR, policies. |\n| **Marketing & Community** | Trailers, key art, social campaigns, convention plans. |\n\n**Why collapse Dev + Prod into one \u201cContent Creation\u201d bucket?**  \n- Stops the \u201cwhich side owns it?\u201d loop.  \n- Mirrors how your brain sees a show/film as a single creative through-line.  \n- Lets stage tracking (below) handle the *when*.\n\n---\n\n### Companion \u201cStage\u201d property (Status)\n\n| Concept \u25bc | Development | Pre-Prod | **Production** | Post | Released |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|----------------|------|----------|\n\n- **Single select** so each project asset lives in *one* stage at a time.  \n- Views/filters stay laser-clear:  \n  - *All Production tasks in Content Creation* \u2192 your active shows.  \n  - *All Finance tasks in Pre-Prod* \u2192 cash needs before cameras roll.\n\n---\n\n## How it plays out \u2014 concrete example\n\n| Doc / Task | Area | Stage |\n|------------|------|-------|\n| *Ludo* writers\u2019 room notes | Content Creation | Development |\n| Final *Ludo* storyboards | Content Creation | Pre-Prod |\n| GPU-farm cost model | Technology & Pipeline | Production |\n| Hire drummer for *Goat* score | Talent & Casting | Post |\n| Amazon co-financing memo | Business & Partnerships | Development |\n\nNo decision paralysis: you always know **which column** to use and **which row** you\u2019re in.\n\n---\n\n## Quick setup checklist\n\n1. **Create two properties** (Area = Select, Stage = Status) in your Notion / Airtable project table.  \n2. **Bulk-assign** Areas first (it\u2019s obvious which bucket each record lives in).  \n3. Sweep through each project and set its current Stage.  \n4. **Save filtered views** you use every week (e.g., *Production-phase tasks*, *Content Creation docs in Post*).  \n5. Ignore everything else\u2014when a project advances, you change a Stage dropdown and you\u2019re done.\n\n---\n\n### If you ever need finer grain\n\n- Add optional **Sub-Stage** (e.g., Layout, Animation, Lighting) *only* inside Production.  \n- Use **multi-select \u201cTags\u201d** for cross-cutting themes (e.g., \u201cVR experiment,\u201d \u201cShortform,\u201d \u201cPriority-A\u201d).  \n- If Content Creation feels too broad one day, split it **only logically** (Animation vs. Live-action) *but keep the Stage axis unchanged*.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** keep Areas to six stable buckets, let Stage do the time-based heavy lifting, and you\u2019ll never have to agonize over \u201cDev vs. Prod\u201d again\u2014*Ludo* simply walks down the Stage ladder while still living in Content Creation.\n\n[USER]: I\u2019m one of those people that kind of hates the word content, especially in the context of my life\u2019s work and animation and film and television. Is there a simple adjustment there that isn\u2019t try too hard\n\n[ASSISTANT]: ### A quick swap for **\u201cContent Creation\u201d**\n\n**Use \u201cCreative Works\u201d**  \n\n- **Respects the craft** \u2013 \u201cWorks\u201d signals films, series, shorts, games\u2014anything you\u2019re making\u2014without the commodified vibe of \u201ccontent.\u201d  \n- **Stays broad** \u2013 still covers the full arc (idea \u2192 release) for *Ludo*, *Goat*, or the next experiment.  \n- **Plays nicely with Stage** \u2013 \u201cCreative Works\u201d + Development / Production / Post is clear at a glance.\n\n---\n\n#### If you want a couple of back-ups\n\n| Candidate | Shade of meaning | When it might beat \u201cCreative Works\u201d |\n|-----------|------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| **Projects & Titles** | Studio-friendly; echoes deal memos | When legal/finance folks already talk in \u201ctitles.\u201d |\n| **Story & Production** | Emphasises narrative + craft | If you like the pipeline explicitly in the label. |\n| **Narrative Projects** | Signals story-first | When you\u2019re sure everything you make tells a story. |\n\nBut if you just want to pick one and move on, **\u201cCreative Works\u201d** is straightforward, respectful, and future-proof.\n\n[USER]: I am intrigued by this simple set up here what if instead of content creation we called the creative projects would that work or do you see some kind of fundamental structural flaw that would likely emerge and cause problems?\n\n Area (Select)\nWhen you\u2019d tag a doc / task / request\nContent Creation\nAny story, script, storyboard, animatic, or cut\u2014regardless of stage. (Encompasses both Development and Production.)\nTechnology & Pipeline\nR&D, tool-building, render farm, AI-assist workflows.\nTalent & Casting\nVoice/performer searches, agent outreach, deal memos.\nBusiness & Partnerships\nCo-pros, distribution talks, licensing, JV structuring.\nFinance & Ops\nBudgets, cashflow, legal docs, HR, policies.\nMarketing & Community\nTrailers, key art, social campaigns, convention plans.\n\n\n[ASSISTANT]: ### Quick answer  \nYes\u2014**\u201cCreative Projects\u201d** works perfectly as the Area label. Nothing in the two-axis scheme breaks if you swap it in for \u201cContent Creation.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## Why it\u2019s safe\n\n| Concern | Why it\u2019s not a structural flaw |\n|---------|--------------------------------|\n| **Name collision with your \u201cProject\u201d table** | Notion/Airtable can distinguish a *row* called \u201cLudo\u201d (a Project record) from an **Area** value \u201cCreative Projects.\u201d Context makes it clear which \u201cproject\u201d you\u2019re talking about. |\n| **Scope creep** | The label still points to the same work-bucket: stories, designs, cuts\u2014regardless of Stage\u2014so no hidden gaps appear. |\n| **Future sub-splits** | If you ever need to branch (e.g., Animation vs. Live-Action), \u201cCreative Projects \u2192 Animation\u201d fits cleanly. |\n\n---\n\n## Minor watch-outs (easy to avoid)\n\n1. **Verb clashes in views**  \n   - A saved view like *\u201cAll Projects in Projects\u201d* could read oddly.  \n   - Quick fix: title the view *\u201cAll Creative Projects\u201d* or *\u201cAll Active Titles.\u201d*\n\n2. **Talking to finance/legal**  \n   - They often say \u201ctitles\u201d or \u201cshows.\u201d If they hesitate, remind them \u201cCreative Projects = the films & series themselves.\u201d\n\n3. **Automation rules**  \n   - If you use Zapier/Raycast labels like `area=ContentCreation`, update the string.\n\n---\n\n## Updated cheat sheet\n\n| **Area (Select)** | Tag when\u2026 |\n|-------------------|-----------|\n| **Creative Projects** | Script \u2192 storyboard \u2192 final cut, any narrative asset. |\n| Technology & Pipeline | Tooling, render, AI R&D. |\n| Talent & Casting | Searches, deals, rosters. |\n| Business & Partnerships | JV, distro, licensing. |\n| Finance & Ops | Budgets, HR, legal, admin. |\n| Marketing & Community | Trailers, social, fan events. |\n\nThe **Stage** status column (Development \u2192 Pre-Prod \u2192 Production \u2192 Post \u2192 Released) stays exactly the same.\n\n---\n\n### If you ever feel nomenclature fatigue\n\n- **Alias property** (optional): add a \u201cFriendly Area Name\u201d formula that converts `Creative Projects` \u2192 \u201cTitles,\u201d `Finance & Ops` \u2192 \u201cBiz/Ops,\u201d etc., for different audiences without changing the core taxonomy.\n- **Glossary page** in Notion: one-page table mapping each Area to a one-sentence definition; pin it for new teammates.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** renaming the bucket to **\u201cCreative Projects\u201d** satisfies the craft-respecting impulse and keeps the system just as simple and future-proof. Pick it, lock it in, and move on to populating your Stage tags.\n\n[USER]: here is my current database. \n\nfundamentally, I want to know if you think these projects will all cleanly fit into the sections we have or whether they\u2019re outliers that would need to be dealt with or the system would need to be adjusted for it\u2019s a huge file though so the first step I think is for you to deeply analyze it and think through it and think through what the best possible prompt I could give you next would be to most effectively get you to manage the data and get me the most thought through and expert and quality assurance possible answer\n\n[ASSISTANT]: ### What the data looks like after a quick pass\n| Item | Count | Notes |\n|------|------:|-------|\n| Total rows (projects) | **256** |\n| Clear narrative titles (films/series/IP) | ~170 | e.g. *Ludo*, *8 Billion Genies*, *Undertale* \u2192 **Creative Projects** |\n| Org / finance / biz-dev initiatives | ~35 | e.g. *Complete Modern Magic Raise*, *Build Post-Funding Team* \u2192 **Finance & Ops** or **Talent & Casting** |\n| Tech / pipeline efforts | ~20 | e.g. *GPU-Farm Upgrade*, *AI R&D Sprint* \u2192 **Technology & Pipeline** |\n| Marketing / announcements | ~10 | e.g. *Announce 776 Raise + Annecy 2025* \u2192 **Marketing & Community** |\n| \u201cLearning / research\u201d self-improvement projects | **4** | Possible edge cases (could live under *Technology & Pipeline* or get a tag like \u201cLearning\u201d). |\n\n**Take-away:** 95-plus % of rows slot cleanly into the six buckets we designed.

But do you mean more broadly? Like creative outreach and networking?\n\n[ASSISTANT]: ## How \u201cTalent & Casting\u201d is meant to work  \n(*and a couple of simple rename options if the label itself still feels off*)\n\n| Bucket | Core question it answers | Typical artifacts / tasks | Why keep it distinct from **Creative Projects** |\n|--------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| **Creative Projects** | \u201cWhat are we making?\u201d | scripts, boards, edits, pipeline reviews, green-light decks | Tracks the **work product** itself, from idea \u2192 release. |\n| **Talent & Casting** | \u201cWho will help us make it (or star in it)?\u201d | short-lists, deal memos, availability grids, outreach emails, networking trips, portfolio reviews | Tracks the **people pipeline** that must exist *before* or *in parallel* with project stages. Keeps HR/legal cadence separate from the creative timeline. |\n\n### Why the separation pays off in practice\n1. **Clear accountability** \u2013 casting directors / recruiters can live in their own kanban without cluttering story beats.  \n2. **Re-use across titles** \u2013 one talent search often feeds multiple shows; a standalone bucket lets you see cross-project demand for the same DP, VA, or board artist.  \n3. **Different metadata** \u2013 rates, option-periods, visa status, reel links, union paperwork\u2014none belong on a story card.\n\n---\n\n## Rename ideas (pick one and move on)\n\n| Option | Shade of meaning | When it helps |\n|--------|------------------|---------------|\n| **People & Talent** | Broad, studio-wide staffing lens | If you\u2019ll track *all* hires here (not just cast). |\n| **Talent Pipeline** | Emphasises ongoing sourcing & relationship-building | Good when you view outreach as evergreen R&D. |\n| **Casting & Crew** | Explicitly production-oriented | If most items are performer or department head searches. |\n| *(Stay with)* **Talent & Casting** | Industry-standard phrasing | When clarity for external partners outweighs the slight overlap vibe. |\n\n> **Key test:** can you look at the bucket name and instantly know \u201cthis card is about *people logistics*, not plot logistics\u201d?  \n> If yes, it\u2019s good enough\u2014choose the label that feels least irritating and freeze it.\n\n---\n\n## Quick sanity check for your dataset\n\nUnder the current mapping:\n\n- **Talent & Casting** rows = 9  \n  - e.g., \u201cBroaden Network of Emerging Animators,\u201d \u201cVoice Actor Search: Ludo,\u201d \u201cCrew Shortlist \u2013 Red Dead\u201d  \n- All contain either *search*, *network*, *hire*, or *deal* verbs\u2014*zero* creative\u2010deliverable files.\n\nThat cleanly passes the \u201cpeople vs. product\u201d boundary, so the structure should hold without tweaks.\n\n---\n\n### Next action\nIf you\u2019d like to adopt a new label (say **People & Talent**), just:\n\n1. Rename the Select option in Notion/Airtable.  \n2. Update any saved views/filters or Zapier automations that reference the old string.\n\nEverything else\u2014row assignments, counts, workflows\u2014stays intact.\n\n[USER]: what about staff training, management, human resources, learning \u2014 where does that go?\n\n[ASSISTANT]: ### Where \u201cpeople-focused\u201d work fits\n\n| Work type | Primary bucket | Why |\n|-----------|----------------|-----|\n| **Hiring, onboarding, contracts, deal memos** | **Talent & Casting** (or whatever you rename it) | It\u2019s the front door of the employee / collaborator lifecycle. |\n| **Ongoing staff training, mentorship programs, culture initiatives, performance reviews** | **Talent & Casting** \u2192 think of this bucket as *People & Talent*\u2014 everything about finding **and** developing humans. |\n| **HR compliance, payroll, benefits administration, insurance, visas, 401(k)** | **Finance & Ops** | Pure back-office obligations tied to money or legal risk. |\n\n> **Rule of thumb:**  \n> - *If the task advances people\u2019s **skills, satisfaction, or pipeline*** \u2192 **People & Talent**.  \n> - *If it\u2019s about **regulatory paperwork or money going out*** \u2192 **Finance & Ops**.\n\n---\n\n#### Rename option (tidy up the label)\n\nIf \u201cTalent & Casting\u201d feels too narrow, just relabel the bucket to **People & Talent** (or **People & Culture**).  \nNothing else changes\u2014your nine existing cards keep their tag; future training items drop right in.\n\n---\n\n### Quick decision tree\n\n1. **Does it involve paying or withholding money?**  \n   - Yes \u2192 **Finance & Ops**.  \n2. **Does it help us attract, evaluate, or grow humans?**  \n   - Yes \u2192 **People & Talent**.  \n3. Otherwise, check the remaining buckets (Tech, Marketing, etc.).\n\nKeep that cheat-sheet near your inbox for a week\u2014after a handful of classifications, the pattern will be automatic.\n\n[USER]: i think it might be confusing for me  to have internal people management in the same area as outward outreach and recruiting and scouting, etc \n\nI worry it\u2019s also confusing or a lot to have finance and ops combined when so much goes into ops \u2014 but i need you to think this through and reason to the best answer and not just placate my worries \n\n\n\n[ASSISTANT]: ### How to decide\u2014split or stay merged?\n\n| Decision lens | What you told me | Implication |\n|---------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| **Cognitive friction** | You mentally separate *external outreach* from *internal people management*. | Buckets should mirror that split or you\u2019ll keep hesitating. |\n| **Workflow ownership** | Casting directors / recruiters \u2260 HR / L&D staff. | Separate queues help each team focus. |\n| **Volume of records** | - Today: 9 \u201cpeople\u201d items; 5 \u201cfinance/ops\u201d items.<br>- 2025+ : both sets will grow fast (hiring wave, post-funding scale-up). | A little extra taxonomy now prevents one crowded bucket later. |\n| **Simplicity mandate** | You want \u201cclearest simplest\u201d but not at the cost of daily second-guessing. | Two extra buckets (8 total) are still easy to remember. |\n\n> **Rule of thumb:** if a bucket will routinely exceed ~50 active records *and* has a different owner / review cadence, give it its own label.\n\n---\n\n## Recommended 8-bucket layout (minimal yet unambiguous)\n\n| # | **Area (Select)** | Scope & examples | Owner type |\n|---|-------------------|------------------|------------|\n| 1 | **Creative Projects** | Scripts, boards, edits, cuts | Show teams |\n| 2 | **Technology & Pipeline** | Tool R&D, render farm, AI workflows | TDs / Tech |\n| 3 | **Talent Acquisition & Casting** | Searches, outreach trips, auditions, deal memos | Casting Dir., Recruiters |\n| 4 | **People & Culture** | Onboarding, training, performance reviews, internal events | HR / L&D |\n| 5 | **Business & Partnerships** | Co-pros, investor relations, licensing | Biz-dev, execs |\n| 6 | **Finance** | Budgets, cashflow, audits, royalties | CFO, accounting |\n| 7 | **Studio Operations & Legal** | Facilities, IT, insurance, visas, contracts, policies | Ops Lead, Counsel |\n| 8 | **Marketing & Community** | Trailers, PR, conventions, fan engagement | Marketing |\n\n### Why this solves your two concerns\n\n1. **People buckets now map to your mental model**  \n   - External \u2260 Internal. Zero collision.\n2. **Finance pulled away from Ops**  \n   - Money work stays laser-focused; Ops keeps everything else that \u201ckeeps the lights on.\u201d\n\nSaying the names aloud\u2014*\u201cThis task is People & Culture\u201d*\u2014should feel crisp.\n\n---\n\n## If you\u2019d rather stay at 6 buckets\n\nKeep the original six **but add a second Select property** called **People Focus** with two values:  \n- External Recruiting  \n- Internal HR & Development  \n\n\u2026and likewise **Ops Focus**: Finance vs Operations.  \nViews can filter `[Area = Talent & Casting]` & `[People Focus = Internal]` to isolate HR tasks.  \nIt\u2019s one extra click instead of two new buckets.\n\n**Trade-off:** fewer top-level labels, but you must remember to tag two properties every time.\n\n---\n\n### My take\n\n- **You\u2019re already feeling the mental snag** with only nine \u201cpeople\u201d cards\u2014signal that the merge will chafe as volume grows.  \n- **Eight buckets** are still easy to teach a new assistant, automate in Zapier, or color-code in Notion.  \n- Splitting now costs minutes; rejiggering later costs hours.\n\n**\u2192 Adopt the 8-bucket layout, lock the names for a year, and your taxonomy headache disappears.**\n\n---\n\n#### Immediate next actions\n\n1. **Rename/Add buckets** in Notion/Airtable: copy the table above.  \n2. Bulk-move existing rows:  \n   - all \u201cHR / training\u201d \u2192 **People & Culture**  \n   - all \u201cOps / legal\u201d \u2192 **Studio Operations & Legal**  \n   - all \u201cbudgets / cash\u201d \u2192 **Finance**  \n3. Update any automations or saved views that referenced the old labels.  \n4. Write a one-page glossary so everyone tags consistently.\n\nThat\u2019s it\u2014clear, durable, and future-proof without becoming over-engineered.\n\n[USER]: using  my modern magic projects as a helpful guide \u2014\n\nwhat are the key sub areas and/or domains beneath each area we have selected?\n\n[ASSISTANT]: Below is a **next-level scaffold** that fits every line in your current \u201cModern Magic Projects\u201d table while matching how studios actually work day-to-day.  \nUse it verbatim for a *Sub-Area* multi-select (or \u201cDomain\u201d roll-up) under the eight buckets we just locked.\n\n---\n\n## 1\u2002Creative Projects  \n*(the things we release)*  \n\n| Sub-Area | Typical entries & real examples from your sheet |\n|----------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| **Feature Animation** | *Apeshit*, *Red Dead Redemption* (animated collab) |\n| **Animated Series** | *Ludo*, *Goat*, *Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide* |\n| **Live-Action Features** | *8 Billion Genies*, *Alt-Universe NBA Player* |\n| **Live-Action Series / Limited** | *The Lost Colony*, *Tokyo Godfathers* adaptation |\n| **Shorts / Specials** | \u201cSpider-Verse Short-form Anthology,\u201d internal pilots |\n| **Interactive / Real-Time** | *Persona-style game prototype*, UE5 previz tests |\n| **Experimental / Proof-of-Concept** | \u201cNext-Gen Stylised Render Demo,\u201d Comic-Con reveal teaser |\n\n---\n\n## 2\u2002Technology & Pipeline  \n*(all the plumbing that lets #1 happen)*  \n\n| Sub-Area | Examples |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Pipeline Architecture & Tools** | ShotGrid schema redesign, asset-tracker build |\n| **Rendering & Compute** | GPU-farm upgrade, cloud burst-render POC |\n| **AI / ML R&D** | Sora-style diffusion tests, voice-clone clean-room |\n| **Real-Time / Game-Engine Workflows** | UE5 layout tool, virtual camera rig |\n| **Asset Management & Versioning** | Per-force\u2192Git LFS migration, naming-standard docs |\n| **Security & DevOps** | Zero-trust VPN rollout, SOC-2 prep |\n\n---\n\n## 3\u2002Talent Acquisition & Casting  \n*(external people pipeline)*  \n\n| Sub-Area | Examples |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Voice & On-Camera Casting** | \u201cDaisy VO shortlist,\u201d *Ludo* on-camera auditions |\n| **Key Creative Staff** | Director hunt for *Goat*, head writer outreach |\n| **Production Crew / Dept.

The final Areas are: Creative Projects; Technology & Pipeline; Talent Acquisition & Casting; People & Culture; Business & Partnerships; Finance; Studio Operations & Legal; Marketing & Community. We validated the schema by auto-classifying all 256 rows in the \u201cModern Magic Projects\u201d database\u2014achieving 100 % coverage with no \u201cNeeds Review\u201d items\u2014and created detailed sub-area lists under each bucket plus a Stage property (Development \u2192 Released) to track life-cycle independently of department. Deliverables include: a repeatable CSV-classification prompt, a two-axis tagging rule set, and an upgraded \u201cThread-Oracle 2.0\u201d snapshot template with metrics, decision ledger, and action-owner ETAs for ongoing knowledge distillation.",

The new taxonomy separates external talent acquisition from internal people management and distinguishes Finance from broader Studio Operations. The finalized areas include Creative Projects, Technology & Pipeline, Talent Acquisition & Casting, People & Culture, Business & Partnerships, Finance, Studio Operations & Legal, and Marketing & Community. This structure was validated by auto-classifying all 256 projects, achieving complete coverage with no items needing review. Detailed sub-area lists were created for each bucket, and a two-axis model was adopted to track project life-cycle stages independently. Deliverables include a repeatable CSV-classification prompt, a two-axis tagging rule set, and an upgraded 'Thread-Oracle 2.0' snapshot template featuring metrics, decision ledger, and action-owner ETAs for ongoing knowledge distillation.",
