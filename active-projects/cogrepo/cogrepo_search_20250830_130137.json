Mixing them muddies ownership. |\n| **2** | **Legal is tucked inside Studio Ops** but drives every deal (IP, co-pros, licensing). | Contract strategy is core to revenue and risk; burying it in facilities understates its cross-functional weight. |\n| **3** | **IT is split** \u2013 production-pipeline engineering lives in \u201cTechnology & Pipeline,\u201d office IT in \u201cStudio Ops.\u201d | Without an explicit divide, tickets ping-pong between teams. |\n| **4** | **Finance vs. Business & Partnerships overlap** on royalties, audits, and investor relations. | Contract economics often require both teams; unclear edges slow decision-making. |\n| **5** | **Marketing & Community** is siloed from Biz-Dev even though fan data informs partnership value and vice-versa. | Lost feedback loop weakens deal leverage and campaign performance. |\n| **6** | **No explicit slot for corporate strategy / exec office.** | Vision-setting and long-range planning may fall through the cracks. |\n\n---\n\n### 2 \u2014 Revised \u201cModern Magic Areas\u201d (8 Pillars + Sub-Domains)\n| # | **Area (Select)** | **Scope & Typical Artifacts** | **Primary Owner(s)** | **Key Sub-Domains / Notes** |\n|---|------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **1** | **Creative Production** | Scripts, boards, animatics, edits, cuts, music, final delivery | Show teams / Producers / Showrunners | Development, Story, Editorial, Post-Sound |\n| **2** | **Pipeline & Production Technology** | DCC tool R&D, render farm, AI workflows, asset management | CTO, Pipeline TDs, DevOps Engineering | Toolchain, Rendering, Automation, Prod-Tech IT |\n| **3** | **Creative Talent & Casting** | Actor/voice searches, auditions, deal memos, specialty crew | Casting Directors, Talent Producers | Casting, Talent Outreach, Deal Negotiation |\n| **4** | **People, Culture & HR** | Employee recruiting, onboarding, L&D, performance, DEI, engagement events | HR Lead, L&D | Internal Recruiting, HR Ops, Culture & Events |\n| **5** | **Business Development & Strategic Partnerships** | Co-pros, distribution, licensing, investor relations, M&A | EVP Biz-Dev, Strategy | JV/Co-Pro, Licensing, Investor Relations |\n| **6** | **Finance & Legal** | Budgets, cashflow, audits, taxes, royalties, contracts, compliance, IP protection | CFO, General Counsel | Accounting, FP&A, Contract Law, IP/Compliance |\n| **7** | **Studio & Corporate Operations** | Facilities, security, corp-IT/help-desk, insurance, visas, policies | COO, Studio Ops | Facilities, Corp-IT, Risk Mgmt., Travel/Visas |\n| **8** | **Marketing, PR & Community** | Trailers, key art, publicity, conventions, social/fan engagement, analytics | CMO, Marketing & Comms | PR, Growth Marketing, Community, Events |\n\n> **Sub-domain hierarchy** clarifies the grey zones:  \n> *Pipeline IT* stays with Area 2; *Corp-IT* lives in Area 7.  \n> Legal now partners directly with Finance (Area 6) and services every deal in Areas 1, 5, 8.\n\n---\n\n### 3 \u2014 Why This Fix Works\n1. **Clear external vs. internal talent lanes** \u2192 faster hiring decisions and cleaner budgeting.  \n2. **Centralised Finance + Legal** \u2192 single source of truth for money **and** risk.  \n3. **Unified Tech pillar** keeps render-farm, AI, and toolchain decisions coherent.  \n4. **Closed feedback loop** between Biz-Dev (Area 5) and Marketing (Area 8) via shared analytics systems.  \n5. **Ops split** distinguishes mission-critical *production tech* from day-to-day *corporate services*.  \n6. **Expandable** \u2013 sub-domains give you knobs to turn without rewriting the top-level taxonomy.\n\n---\n\n### 4 \u2014 Next Steps\n1. **Map every existing project line-item** to the new Area \u2192 Sub-domain (two-column import in Airtable/Notion).  \n2. **Update RACI or DACI charts** so each pillar\u2019s decision rights are explicit.  \n3. **Create cross-pillar liaisons** (e.g., Finance-Legal \u2192 Biz-Dev \u2192 Marketing loop).  \n4. **Quarterly taxonomy review** to ensure emerging workflows (e.g., real-time game engine production) slot cleanly.\n\n[USER]: I get a little confused about number three creative Be a sub area of creator production unless we\u2019re talking about the general outreach and networking for creative partners collaborators and the like what do you think? Should there be a tweak here?\n\n[ASSISTANT]: ## Quick Gut-Check\n\n| Choice | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| **A. Make \u201cCreative Talent & Casting\u201d a *sub-area* under Creative Production** | \u2022 Mirrors day-to-day workflow (showrunner + casting director)<br>\u2022 Fewer top-level buckets | \u2022 Blurs with internal HR recruiting<br>\u2022 Casting suddenly \u201cbelongs\u201d to one show vs. serving many<br>\u2022 Long-lead outreach/networking can get deprioritized |\n| **B. Keep it a *stand-alone* pillar but sharpen the label & scope** | \u2022 Clean external vs. internal talent split<br>\u2022 Central hub can pipeline talent across shows<br>\u2022 Outreach/networking lives here year-round | \u2022 Adds one more top-level area to remember |\n\n**My take:** Option B wins\u2014*if* we tweak the name and boundaries so nobody mistakes it for HR.\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Tweak\n\n**Rename pillar #3 to:**\n\n> **External Talent & Casting**  \n> *Scope:* voice/performer casting, director/EP outreach, freelance creatives, deal memos, relationship-building trips, talent databases.\n\n**Boundary rules**\n\n| What **lives** here | What **doesn\u2019t** |\n|---------------------|------------------|\n| \u2022 Sourcing & signing actors/voice talent<br>\u2022 Outreach to directors, show-running partners, storyboard aces, etc.<br>\u2022 Talent scouting at festivals/online<br>\u2022 Maintaining creator-network CRM | \u2022 Full-time employee hiring \u2192 **People & Culture**<br>\u2022 On-boarding, payroll, benefits \u2192 **People & Culture**<br>\u2022 Contract language & IP ownership \u2192 **Finance & Legal** |\n\n*(You can document this in a one-page RACI so the hand-offs are crystal clear.)*\n\n---\n\n## Minor Knock-On Adjustments\n\n1. **People & Culture** \u2192 explicitly labeled \u201cInternal HR & L&D\u201d in its description.  \n2. **Creative Production** sub-domains list \u201cCasting Input\u201d to signal collaboration without ownership.\n\n---\n\n### TL;DR\n\nKeep the pillar separate, but **re-name and fence it**: \u201cExternal Talent & Casting\u201d handles all outward-facing creative outreach; \u201cPeople & Culture\u201d remains the home for internal employee life-cycle. This preserves clear swim lanes while still matching your creative workflow.\n\n[USER]: what about creative networking that might be exact right title but that to me is getting more added because if we want to convey, it\u2019s really less about voice talent or acting talent and more about networking, nurturing creative, collaborators, partners, and hires on the individual level and the collective or creative company level as part of a pipeline that converts that into real projects and assets (but doesn\u2019t overlap with coziness development so let\u2019s be thoughtful about the company component  \n\n[ASSISTANT]: ### Refining Area #3 \u2014 From \u201cExternal Talent & Casting\u201d to a True **Creator Network**\n\n| Aspect | Current Wording | Pain Point | Proposed Fix |\n|--------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|\n| **Name** | External Talent & Casting | \u201cCasting\u201d implies actors/voices; doesn\u2019t convey ongoing relationship-building with studios, writers, directors, boutique shops, etc. | **Creator Network & Collaborations** |\n| **Core Mission** | Fill roles for shows | Too transactional; misses pipeline/portfolio thinking | **Scout \u2192 Nurture \u2192 Activate** a global network of individual creators **and** creative companies that can plug into any Modern Magic project |\n| **Key Outputs** | Deal memos, audition tapes | Doesn\u2019t show deal-flow of new partners or thought-leadership events | \u2022 Warm-intro database (CRM) <br>\u2022 Talent/Studio scouting reports <br>\u2022 Creator summit / labs <br>\u2022 Option or first-look agreements |\n| **Primary Interfaces** | Creative Production, People & Culture | Overlaps with Biz-Dev on studio co-pros; with HR on full-time hires | Explicit hand-offs (see matrix below) |\n\n---\n\n#### Updated Definition\n\n> **Creator Network & Collaborations**  \n> _Builds and maintains the living ecosystem of **external storytellers, directors, writers, art houses, boutique studios, and specialty vendors** that Modern Magic can tap for current and future projects. Focuses on relationships, pipelines, and strategic creator alignment\u2014not day-player casting._\n\n##### Scope (Think Funnel)\n\n1. **Discovery & Scouting** \u2013 festivals, online portfolios, social platforms  \n2. **Relationship Nurture** \u2013 labs, short-form pilots, creator mixers, mentorships  \n3. **Activation** \u2013 matching creators/shops to projects, structuring option or services deals  \n4. **Retention & Growth** \u2013 feedback loops, recurring collaborations, talent analytics\n\n##### Out-of-Scope\n\n| Goes **Elsewhere** | Reason |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| **Voice / screen acting auditions** | Remain a *sub-domain* inside Creative Production (casting team works per-show). |\n| **Full-time hires, visas, payroll** | People & Culture (HR). |\n| **Company-to-company co-production or distribution deals** | Business Dev & Strategic Partnerships. |\n| **Contract language, IP terms** | Finance & Legal. |\n\n---\n\n#### Interaction Matrix (RACI-style snapshot)\n\n| Activity | Creator Network | Creative Prod. | Biz-Dev | People & Culture | Finance & Legal |\n|----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Scout & tag promising studio | **R** | C | I | I | I |\n| Host creator summit | **A** | C | I | I | I |\n| Attach director to Project X | **C** | **R/A** | I | I | C |\n| Draft services deal | I | C | C | I | **R** |\n| Convert indie studio to full-time satellite team | C | I | I | **R/A** | C |\n\n> **Legend:** R = Responsible, A = Accountable, C = Consulted, I = Informed\n\n---\n\n### Minor Taxonomy Ripple-Fixes\n\n1. **Creative Production** keeps a sub-section **\u201cCasting (Actors/Voices)\u201d** to avoid dilution.  \n2. **Business Dev & Strategic Partnerships** description now explicitly says \u201cinstitutional & corporate deals (studios, platforms, investors).\u201d  \n3. Add the CRM/tool-stack (e.g., Airtable + Notion view) as a shared resource between Creator Network, Biz-Dev, and People & Culture to prevent double-entry.\n\n---\n\n### Next Actions\n\n1. **Rename Area #3 to \u201cCreator Network & Collaborations\u201d** in your master list.  \n2. **Publish a one-pager** with the scope/out-of-scope table and RACI so teams know where to route work.  \n3. **Audit existing \u201ccasting\u201d and \u201coutreach\u201d projects** \u2192 re-tag under either Creator Network or Casting sub-domain.  \n4. **Set up a quarterly cross-area sync** (Creator Network + Biz-Dev + Creative Prod.) to surface talent/partner intel and convert it into greenlit projects.\n\nThis tweak maintains clear swim lanes, foregrounds the strategic creator-ecosystem work you care about, and leaves transactional casting and HR where they belong.\n\n[USER]: ideally, within a notion taxonomy, how should sub areas or domains within the area be handled? I can build sub areas within the database itself, but there may be a lot of sub areas then because I don\u2019t think notion lets you split some items between individual areas or yeah I think they all end up getting listed in the samedatabase. What\u2019s the best way to handle this do you think simplest etc. and simplest moving forward they could also just be page areas and not have dedicated database definitions that specifically to define the Siberia. It could just be a design element. You tell me.\n\n[ASSISTANT]: ## 1. First Principles to Keep You Sane\n| Principle | Why It Matters in Notion |\n|-----------|-------------------------|\n| **One truth per row** | Treat every \u201cthing that can be worked on\u201d (project, task, note, deal) as a single record in one master DB. |\n| **Top-level always explicit** | *Area* should remain a Select so it\u2019s sortable, groupable, and never ambiguous. |\n| **Sub-areas must stay lightweight** | People won\u2019t tag granularly if it feels like paperwork. |\n| **Zero duplicate typing** | The UI for adding a new record must involve < 3 clicks, or tagging will drift. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Three Viable Patterns\n\n### Pattern A \u2014 **Prefix Tagging (Ultra-Simple)**\n*One Projects DB \u2022 2 properties:*\n- `Area` \u2014 Select  \n- `Tag` \u2014 Multi-select, prefix each value with its parent \u2192 `Creative \u2022 Story`, `Creative \u2022 Editorial`\n\n**Pros**:  \n- Fast to add new tags (no extra tables).  \n- Works with Notion\u2019s \u201cGroup by\u201d (all Creative tags sit together alphabetically).\n\n**Cons**:  \n- Anyone can fat-finger a new tag and break consistency.  \n- You can\u2019t store metadata (owner, description) for each sub-area.\n\n---\n\n### Pattern B \u2014 **Relation + Roll-up (Structured & Scalable)** **\u2190 Recommended**\n*1\ufe0f\u20e3 Projects DB*  \n*2\ufe0f\u20e3 Sub-Areas DB* (rows: *Concept Art Studio*, *Story Summit*, *Render R&D \u2026*)  \n\n| Projects DB | Sub-Areas DB |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| `Sub-Area` (Relation \u2192 Sub-Areas) | `Parent Area` (Select) |\n| `Area` (Roll-up \u2192 Sub-Area.Parent Area) | Metadata columns (Owner, Slack channel, SOP link\u2026) |\n\n**Workflow**\n\n1. Creator clicks \u201cNew Project\u201d \u2192 picks a *Sub-Area* from a filtered relation list.  \n2. *Area* auto-populates via roll-up\u2014no duplicate data entry.  \n3. Dashboards can group by either column.\n\n**Pros**:  \n- Canonical list prevents tag chaos.  \n- Each sub-area can have its own owner, SOP page, KPI roll-ups.  \n- Easy to replace/merge sub-areas without touching every Project row.\n\n**Cons**:  \n- Slightly heavier UI (relation picker).  \n- Native Notion cannot *dynamically* filter relation choices by Area, but you can pre-build **\u201cNew Project\u201d templates** per Area that open a filtered linked view of the Sub-Areas table for quick selection\u2014eliminating noise.\n\n---\n\n### Pattern C \u2014 **Page Hierarchy Only (Design-First)**\nMake eight top-level pages (one per Area). Inside each:  \n- Embed a \u201cProjects\u201d DB view filtered by that Area.  \n- Use headings/toggles for visual sub-areas; no database field at all.\n\n**Pros**:  \n- Zero schema complexity.  \n- New hires grok it instantly.\n\n**Cons**:  \n- You lose the ability to slice data across sub-areas (e.g., \u201cshow all \u2018Story Lab\u2019 projects company-wide\u201d).  \n- Harder automation / KPI roll-ups.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Quick Side-by-Side\n\n| Feature | Prefix Tag | Relation + Roll-up | Page-Only |\n|---------|------------|--------------------|-----------|\n| **Adds in 1-click?** | \u2705 | \u26a0\ufe0f (use templates) | \u2705 |\n| **Metadata per sub-area** | \u274c | \u2705 | \u274c |\n| **Prevents tag drift** | \u26a0\ufe0f | \u2705 | \u2705 |\n| **Cross-area analytics** | \u2705 | \u2705 | \u274c |\n| **Future-proof (new systems)** | \u26a0\ufe0f | \u2705 | \u26a0\ufe0f |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Implementation Blueprint for Pattern B\n\n1. **Create \u201cSub-Areas\u201d DB**  \n   - Properties: `Name` (title), `Parent Area` (Select), `Owner`, `Description`, etc.\n\n2. **Augment \u201cProjects\u201d DB**  \n   - Add Relation \u2192 *Sub-Areas*.  \n   - Add Roll-up \u201cArea (auto)\u201d pulling `Parent Area`.  \n   - Optionally hide the original manual `Area` field to enforce single source of truth.\n\n3. **Project Templates**  \n   - One template per *Area*: pre-filters the sub-area relation chooser to only children of that Area (via a linked Sub-Areas view).  \n   - Pre-fills common fields (e.g., default status, doc links).\n\n4. **Dashboards**  \n   - Exec view grouped by `Area (auto)` \u2192 `Sub-Area`.  \n   - Owner view filtered by `Sub-Area.Owner = @Me`.\n\n5. **Governance**  \n   - Limit who can create new rows in Sub-Areas DB.  \n   - Quarterly review to merge or archive stale sub-areas.\n\n---\n\n## 5. If You Want *Even Simpler* Today\n\n1. Start with **Pattern A** (prefix tags) for the next 30 days.  \n2. Monitor tag entropy; if it stays clean, keep it.  \n3. If it drifts, migrate to Pattern B\u2014Notion\u2019s CSV export/import makes conversion painless.\n\n---\n\n### TL;DR\n- **Use Relation + Roll-up** if you need clean analytics and owner metadata.  \n- **Prefix Tags** if team speed trumps structure.  \n- **Page-only** hierarchy is fine for read-only dashboards but limits data slicing.  \nPick the lightest pattern that still enforces \u201cone truth per row\u201d and you\u2019ll avoid taxonomy sprawl.\n\n[USER]: show me exactly what sub areas db woiod look like in table for   \u2014 what the entries would be, the properties  etc \n\nand think deeply \u2014 is this definitely the best way (and most notion future  proof \n\n[ASSISTANT]: ### Sub-Areas Database \u2014 Schema\n\n| Property | Type | Purpose / Notes |\n|-----------|------|-----------------|\n| **Name** | Title | Canonical sub-area label (ex: *Story Lab*). |\n| **Parent Area** | Select (8 options) | Rolls up into the master *Areas* taxonomy. |\n| **Owner** | Person | Single DRI (or multi-select for co-leads). |\n| **Slack / Channel** | Text or URL | `#story-lab`, `#render-rnd` \u2026 |\n| **SOP Link** | URL | Points to the how-we-work page / Google Doc. |\n| **Status** | Select | Active \u00b7 Paused \u00b7 Archived. |\n| **Created On** | Date | First use (helps lifecycle reviews). |\n| **Notes** | Rich Text | Quick description, KPIs, meeting cadence. |\n\n*(Add further metadata\u2014KPI roll-ups, budget, pipeline stage\u2014only if genuinely used; Notion tolerates extra columns but the UI doesn\u2019t.)*\n\n---\n\n### Example Rows\n\n| Name | Parent Area | Owner | Slack / Channel | SOP Link | Status | Notes |\n|------|-------------|-------|-----------------|----------|--------|-------|\n| Story Lab | Creative Production | Rodney R. | #story-lab | notion.so/sop/storylab | Active | Pilots & shorts for new IP. |\n| Editorial | Creative Production | J.

Mitigate with template pages or linked-DB views that pre-filter by Area\u2014keeps the UI clean for end users.\n\n**Bottom Line:**  \nThis structure balances governance and agility\u2014tight enough to avoid chaos, flexible enough to absorb new workflows, and fully compatible with Notion\u2019s ongoing roadmap (Synced databases, formulas 2.0, AI autofill).\n\n[USER]: it feels like when i add a sub area to an item (triggering tbe rollup) it might be pretty hard to find the right sub area quickly if there\u2019s a ton of sub areas like three or 45 per area at least\n\n[ASSISTANT]: ## Finding the right Sub-Area quickly \u2014 6 proven tactics\n\n> With ~30\u201345 sub-areas per Area you\u2019re still under 300 total records.  \n> Notion\u2019s relation search bar + a few smart guards make picking painless.\n\n### 1. **Filter the relation to an \u201cArea-specific view\u201d** *(best UX)*  \nNotion now lets you **limit relation choices to a view**.\n\n1. In **Sub-Areas DB** create 8 views (one per Area) filtered on `Parent Area`.  \n2. In **Projects DB** open the `Sub-Area` relation\u2019s **Property settings \u2192 Limit to a view \u2192 choose \u201cCreative Production only\u201d** (or whichever template you\u2019re editing).  \n3. Clone that Project template for each Area and point the relation at the matching view.  \n   *Result: When a creator opens the template, the relation picker only lists 30\u201345 relevant sub-areas, not the full mega-list.*\n\n### 2. **Turn sub-area names into fast-type mnemonics**  \nPrefix with a **short, unique code** so three keystrokes finds any record:\n\n| Parent Area | Prefix style | Example entries (user types \u201csto\u201d\u2026) |\n|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Creative Prod. | **CP-** | `CP-Story Lab`, `CP-Editorial`, `CP-Previz` |\n| Pipeline & Tech | **PT-** | `PT-Render R&D`, `PT-Realtime`, \u2026 |\n\nType-ahead narrows instantly\u2014even inside a huge table.\n\n### 3. **Hide clutter with an \u201cActive only\u201d filter**  \nAdd `Status` to Sub-Areas (Active \u00b7 Paused \u00b7 Archived) and filter the view you expose to users to **Active**. Legacy rows vanish from the picker but remain available for roll-ups/history.\n\n### 4. **Lean on Project templates, not ad-hoc entry**  \nCreators should almost never hit **\u201cNew\u201d** directly:\n\n- Eight \u201c\u2795 New Creative Project\u201d, \u201c\u2795 New Biz-Dev Deal\u201d, etc. buttons  \n- Each uses the Area-filtered template (#1) and pre-sets common fields.\n\nThis cuts decision-fatigue and tagging mistakes to near zero.\n\n### 5. **Add a backup Select field for \u201cArea Quick-Pick\u201d (optional)**  \nIf a user forgets to choose a sub-area\u2014or genuinely doesn\u2019t know yet\u2014  \ngive them a simple Select `Area (temp)` with the 8 choices.  \nA weekly \u201corphan view\u201d catches rows that need a true Sub-Area and nudges owners to tag properly.\n\n### 6. **Keep the list tight: quarterly pruning**  \n- Merge near-duplicates (\u201cStory Incubator\u201d vs. \u201cStory Lab\u201d).  \n- Archive sub-areas that haven\u2019t been attached to a project in > 12 months.  \nEven with growth you\u2019ll hover around a human-searchable set.\n\n---\n\n## Why the Relation + Roll-up model still wins\n\n| Concern | How the model handles it |\n|---------|--------------------------|\n| **Picker overload** | Area-filtered views + type-ahead (tactics 1 & 2). |\n| **Schema bloat** | Only one extra DB; no duplicate properties in Projects. |\n| **Future proof** | Works with Notion\u2019s upcoming synced-DB, buttons, API filters; easy to migrate to other tools via unique IDs. |\n| **Governance** | You can lock Sub-Areas DB creation to ops leads, preventing wild growth. |\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nStay with Relation + Roll-up.  \nAdd the view-filter and mnemonic prefixes; the picker friction disappears while you keep the analytics and metadata powers you\u2019ll need next year.\n\n[USER]: could we make it in notion so that in any entry with area and sub area relations \u2014 picking an area limits the sub area selections to those linked to that area? is there any way to do something like that?\n\n[ASSISTANT]: Picking an **Area** first can\u2019t (yet) **dynamically** shrink the list of **Sub-Areas** that appear in a Relation property. Notion\u2019s Relation picker is always \u201call-records from the linked DB.\u201d  However, you can get 90 % of the way there with a mix of filtered views, templates, and (if desired) native Automations that fill the field for users. Below is the precise reality and the least-fiddly workaround stack.\n\n---\n\n## 1 | What Notion Can & Can\u2019t Do Today\n\n| Capability | Native? | Source |\n|------------|---------|--------|\n| Show **any** page from the linked database in the Relation picker | \u2714\ufe0e | \ue200cite\ue202turn3search9\ue201 |\n| Restrict the picker to a **saved database view** you specify (static) | \u2714\ufe0e | \ue200cite\ue202turn3search9\ue201 |\n| Dynamically filter that picker based on **another property in the same row** (e.g., \u201cArea = Creative Production\u201d) | **\u2718 \u2014not supported** | \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue202turn0search1\ue201 |\n| Auto-set a property when another property changes (Database **Automations**) | \u2714\ufe0e | \ue200cite\ue202turn5search5\ue202turn10view0\ue201 |\n\n> **Bottom line:** Dependent drop-downs are still on many users\u2019 wish lists, but aren\u2019t in the product as of April 2025. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 2 | Workable Workflows\n\n### 2.1 Template-Scoped Relation Views (fastest for creators)\n\n1. **Create eight saved views** in the **Sub-Areas** DB (one per Area) filtered on `Parent Area`.  \n2. In each **\u201cNew Project\u201d template** inside your Projects DB, open the **Relation \u2192 Property \u2192 Limit to view** menu and select that Area-specific view.  \n   *Result: a Story-team user opening the \u201cNew Creative Project\u201d template only sees the \u00b140 Creative Sub-Areas\u2014not Finance, Ops, etc.*\n\n*(Static filter; if someone later swaps the Area value, the picker list won\u2019t change, but the already-chosen Sub-Area remains valid.)*\n\n### 2.2 Mnemonic Prefixes for Quick Type-Ahead\n\nGive every Sub-Area a short code:\n\n| Code | Example entry |\n|------|---------------|\n| **CP-** | `CP-Story Lab`, `CP-Editorial` |\n| **PT-** | `PT-Render R&D`, `PT-AI Pipeline` |\n\nThree keystrokes (\u201c**CP-st\u2026**\u201d) finds any Creative Sub-Area instantly, even in a 300-row list. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201\n\n### 2.3 Native \u201cSet Property\u201d Automation (optional polish)\n\n*Trigger:* `When Area is edited`  \n*Action:* `Set Sub-Area \u2192 first matching record where Parent Area = Area`\n\nThis pre-fills a default Sub-Area (e.g., \u201cUnsorted\u201d) when someone forgets to pick one, and can nudge them via a second action that @-mentions them. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search5\ue202turn10view0\ue201\n\n### 2.4 Quarterly Prune & Archive\n\nAdd a `Status` Select to Sub-Areas (Active \u00b7 Paused \u00b7 Archived). Filter the picker to **Active** only; older rows stay for history but never clutter UI. \ue200cite\ue202turn12search7\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 3 | Exactly How the **Sub-Areas** DB Should Look\n\n| Property | Type | Comment |\n|----------|------|---------|\n| **Name** | Title | `PT-Render R&D`, `CP-Story Lab` |\n| **Parent Area** | Select (8 options) | Drives roll-up to Projects DB |\n| **Owner** | Person | DRI |\n| **Status** | Select | Active / Paused / Archived |\n| **Slack Channel** | URL | `#render-rnd` |\n| **SOP Link** | URL | Process doc |\n| **Created On** | Date | For lifecycle reviews |\n| **Notes** | Rich text | KPIs, cadence |\n\n*(Keep extra columns minimal to avoid slow pickers.)* \ue200cite\ue202turn9search0\ue202turn9search2\ue201\n\n---\n\n## 4 | Why This Remains the Most Future-Proof Path\n\n* **Single source of truth** \u2192 analytics & roll-ups stay clean.  \n* **Works with every new Notion feature** (Buttons, Automations, API filters). \ue200cite\ue202turn5search4\ue202turn5search6\ue201  \n* **Easily migratable** if Notion someday ships true dependent relations\u2014you\u2019ll only tweak the picker, not restructure data.  \n* **No vendor lock-in**\u2014prefixes and relation IDs export cleanly to CSV or the API. \ue200cite\ue202turn5search3\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## 5 | Recommended Next Moves\n\n1. **Add the eight filtered views** in Sub-Areas, then update each Project template\u2019s Relation settings.  \n2. **Prefix-rename** existing Sub-Area rows for fast search.  \n3. (Optional) **Build a one-line Automation** that fills `Sub-Area = \u201c\u00c1rea Unsorted\u201d` when a new Project is created.  \n4. Schedule a **quarterly 10-minute audit**: archive dead Sub-Areas and merge dupes.\n\n> Until Notion gives us real conditional relations, these steps give you near-zero friction tagging while preserving the robust analytics you need.\n\n[USER]: then \u2014 think deeply \u2014 beneath these areas sits project -what about sub projects? should i be using those or is too much? \n\n[ASSISTANT]: At the **\u201cProjects\u201d level you have two overlapping needs**:\n\n1. **Delivery hierarchy** \u2014 sometimes a big initiative (*Feature Film*) truly breaks into child projects (*Animation Test Reel*, *Marketing Microsite*).  \n2. **Execution breakdown** \u2014 the day-to-day steps, phases, and tasks that move any project forward.  \n\nBelow is a decision framework and an exact Notion schema that satisfies both without drowning you in extra clicks.\n\n---\n\n## Should you add \u201cSub-Projects\u201d?\n\n### When a self-relation **is worth it**\n| Signal a page **deserves its own \u201csub-project\u201d row** | Why a simple task is not enough |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| \u2022 It spans **multiple sprints / departments** (e.g., Story, Tech, Biz-Dev) | Tasks can\u2019t hold cross-team budgets or KPIs |\n| \u2022 It has a **distinct budget, deadline, or green-light gate** | Financial roll-ups become messy in a task list |\n| \u2022 Success can ship **independent of the parent** (e.g., a spin-off short) | Tasks assume parent must finish first |\n\nIf none of those fire, you\u2019re better off tracking the work as **phases or tasks** inside the parent project.\n\n### When to say \u201cno\u201d  \n- Purely sequential work (*Storyboard \u2192 Animatic \u2192 Final*): treat as **phases/milestones**.  \n- House-keeping experiments that end inside a week: just create **tasks or sub-tasks**.  \nCommunity feedback shows sub-item over-nesting leads to filter chaos and date-shift bugs \u2014 users who tried deep hierarchies usually backtracked to a simpler layer model \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue201.\n\n---\n\n## Three-layer model that stays quick in Notion\n\n| Layer | Where it lives | Key fields |\n|-------|---------------|-----------|\n| **Project** | `Projects` DB row | *Area (roll-up)* \u00b7 *Owner* \u00b7 *Budget* |\n| **Sub-Project** (only when truly separate) | **Same `Projects` DB** with a **self-relation** field `Parent Project` | Adds *Parent Project*, plus formula roll-ups (child count, % complete) |\n| **Tasks / Phases** | `Tasks` DB (related to Project) **OR** new built-in **Sub-Items** under Tasks | *Status* \u00b7 *Due* \u00b7 *Dependency* |\n\n### Why this beats a separate \u201cSub-Projects\u201d database\n- **One table, one Kanban**: any Board view can group by `Parent Project` or Status.  \n- Self-relations are first-class and supported by Notion\u2019s sub-item UX for tasks \ue200cite\ue202turn1view0\ue201.  \n- Automations can fill `Parent Project` defaults or sync roll-ups without code \ue200cite\ue202turn2search0\ue201.\n\n---\n\n## Exact schema additions\n\n| Property (Projects DB) | Type | Usage |\n|------------------------|------|-------|\n| **Parent Project** | Relation \u2192 same DB (allow multiple = **off**) | Creates the hierarchy |\n| **Sub-Projects** | Roll-up (count) | `Parent Project \u2192 Count` |\n| **% Child Complete** | Roll-up (formula) | `Parent Project \u2192 Avg(Completion %)` |\n| **Breadcrumb** *(optional)* | Formula | `if(empty(Parent Project), Name, Parent Project.Name + \" / \" + Name)` makes it searchable |\n\n*(The Tasks DB keeps its existing Project relation; leave Sub-Items enabled for fine-grained steps \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201.)*\n\n---\n\n## UX safeguards\n\n1. **Template buttons** \u2013 each Area page hosts a \u201c\u2795 New Project\u201d and \u201c\u2795 New Sub-Project\u201d button that pre-sets the `Parent Project` and filters the `Sub-Area` picker to the correct view \ue200cite\ue202turn2search3\ue201.  \n2. **Automation guard-rail** \u2013 if `Parent Project` is empty **and** `Area` \u2260 \u201cCreative Production\u201d, fire a Notion automation that pings the creator to choose either a parent or mark as top-level \ue200cite\ue202turn2search5\ue201.  \n3. **Quarterly prune** \u2013 archive any sub-project row whose `Status` is \u201cCompleted\u201d for >90 days; this keeps the relation picker snappy (Notion filter + archived status hides them by default) \ue200cite\ue202turn12search7\ue201.  \n4. **Mnemonic naming** \u2013 use the same two-letter prefixes you\u2019re applying to Sub-Areas (e.g., `CP-`) so type-ahead finds a parent in <3 keystrokes \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201.  \n\n---\n\n## Alternative: Phases instead of Sub-Projects\n\nIf you mainly need sequential gates\u2014*R&D \u2192 Pre-Prod \u2192 Prod*\u2014skip the self-relation and:\n\n1. Add a **\u201cPhase\u201d Select** in Projects DB (`Discovery \u00b7 Build \u00b7 Launch`).  \n2. Or create a **\u201cPhases\u201d DB** related to Projects (one row per gate) for Gantt views; Notion docs show phased timeline templates \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue201.  \n\nThis keeps dashboards flat while still letting you roll up burn-down or budget per phase.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\n- **Use sub-projects sparingly** \u2014 only for child initiatives that justify their own scope, budget, and timeline.  \n- Implement them via a **self-relation in the existing Projects database**; it\u2019s the lightest schema and plays nicely with automations, formulas, and future Notion roadmap items \ue200cite\ue202turn2search2\ue201.  \n- For everything else, rely on **Phases and Sub-Tasks** to keep the surface area small and the team\u2019s clicks minimal while retaining powerful roll-ups and analytics.\n\n[USER]: Give me my current areas list \n\n[ASSISTANT]: **Current Modern Magic Areas**\n\n1. **Creative Production**  \n2. **Pipeline & Production Technology**  \n3. **Creator Network & Collaborations**  \n4. **People, Culture & HR (Internal HR & L&D)**  \n5. **Business Development & Strategic Partnerships**  \n6. **Finance & Legal**  \n7. **Studio & Corporate Operations**  \n8. **Marketing, PR & Community**\n\n[USER]: Strategy setting is key for our company -- does that fit into Business Development and Strategic Partnership ? Operations?\n\nIs it its own area? Sub-Area?\n\n[ASSISTANT]: **TL;DR\u2002** Strategy-setting deserves its own discrete home so it can look *over* the business, not just *through* one lens. For a growth-stage studio like Modern Magic, the leanest, future-proof approach is to create a **sub-area called \u201cCorporate Strategy & Office of the CEO\u201d** that lives **inside Business Development & Strategic Partnerships** but reports directly to the CEO/CSO. This keeps your eight-pillar taxonomy intact while giving Strategy a clear charter, owner, and resourcing model. As the slate and capital structure get more complex, you can promote the sub-area to a ninth top-level \u201cCorporate Strategy\u201d pillar without changing any downstream database links.\n\n---\n\n## Why Strategy Doesn\u2019t Cleanly Fit Inside Ops **or** Biz-Dev\n\n| Function | Core Time Horizon | Primary Metrics | Typical Deliverables | Why It\u2019s *Not* Strategy |\n|-----------|------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n| **Operations** | 0\u201312 months | Cost/unit, uptime, cycle time | SOPs, capacity plans | Optimises *current* system\u2014not where to go next.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search2\ue202turn0search5\ue201 |\n| **Biz-Dev / Partnerships** | 3\u201336 months | Deal value, pipeline velocity | Co-pros, JV term sheets | Executes growth *vectors* the strategy team prioritises.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search6\ue202turn0search3\ue201 |\n| **Corporate Strategy** | 1\u20135 years | NPV of portfolio, ROIC vs. peers | Long-range plan, M&A theses, capability road-map | Integrates market intel, finance, tech, talent into one north star.\ue200cite\ue202turn1search8\ue202turn0search0\ue201 |\n\nBest-practice studies (Office of Strategy Management, Kaplan & Norton; CSO job-scope surveys) show that when Strategy is buried under Ops it becomes fire-fighting, and when buried in Biz-Dev it becomes deal-chasing rather than company-shaping.\ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn1search1\ue201\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Structure\n\n### Sub-Area: **Corporate Strategy & Office of the CEO**\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| **Parent Area** | Business Development & Strategic Partnerships |\n| **Owner** | Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) or CEO until role is hired |\n| **Charter** | \u2022 Craft 3- to 5-year strategic plan \u2022 Run annual OKR / Balanced Scorecard process \u2022 Originate M&A/IP slate theses \u2022 Chair green-light councils \u2022 Maintain competitive-intel dashboard |\n| **Core Interfaces** | Finance & Legal (valuation, capital) \u2022 Biz-Dev (deal execution) \u2022 Pipeline Tech (build/buy decisions) \u2022 People & Culture (workforce plan) |\n\n> **Why this scales:** Strategy already touches every deal Biz-Dev negotiates; housing it there keeps one \u201cgrowth cluster,\u201d while the dotted-line to the CEO preserves altitude and authority. When Modern Magic later hits Series B and owns multiple labels, spin it out as Pillar 9 with zero relinking\u2014simply flip the `Parent Area` Select on the Sub-Area record.\n\n---\n\n## Notion Implementation Snapshot\n\n**Sub-Areas DB \u2014 new row**\n\n| Name | Parent Area | Owner | Status | Notes |\n|------|-------------|-------|--------|-------|\n| CSO \u2014 Corporate Strategy & Office of the CEO | Business Development & Strategic Partnerships | Rodney R.
