## Conclusion

Phase 2A represents a major milestone in building the Animation Financing Navigator. We have successfully translated the complex Animation Financing Ontology into robust, validated, production-ready Python data models.

The foundation is now in place to:
1. Ingest real-world policy and market data (Phase 3)
2. Build sophisticated calculation engines (Phase 2B)
3. Create optimization and simulation capabilities (Phase 2C)
4. Develop user-facing interfaces (Phase 4)

**Next Immediate Action:** Begin data curation using the Parameterization Prompt to populate policy and market rate data.
