## Conclusion

**Phases 2A and 3 represent major milestones in building the Animation Financing Navigator.**

We have successfully:
1. ✅ Translated the complex Animation Financing Ontology into robust, validated, production-ready Python data models (Phase 2A)
2. ✅ Populated the system with comprehensive real-world data from 8 major jurisdictions plus complete market parameters (Phase 3)
3. ✅ Created a production-ready foundation for calculation engines and optimization

**What's Now Possible:**
- Load any tax incentive policy and calculate accurate net benefits
- Model complete capital stacks with real market rates
- Execute waterfalls with industry-standard fees
- Compare jurisdictions and financing strategies
- Generate optimized scenarios (next phase)

**The Data:**
- 8 tax policies covering UK, Ireland (2), Canada (3), USA (2)
- Rates ranging from 18% (Ontario) to 40% (Ireland Scéal) to 52% (Quebec stacked)
- 50+ market financing parameters with low/base/high ranges
- Complete distribution, equity, and debt economics
- All sourced from official government and industry publications

**Major Insights Discovered:**
