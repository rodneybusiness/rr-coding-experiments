## Recommended Usage

### In the Navigator Model

These data files are designed to:

4. **Calibrate Monte Carlo simulations** ‚Üí Use ranges (low/base/high) for uncertainty modeling
5. **Generate scenario comparisons** ‚Üí Compare different jurisdictional strategies

### Next Steps for Integration

1. **Create policy loader utility** ‚Üí Parse JSON ‚Üí IncentivePolicy Pydantic objects
2. **Build parameter lookup service** ‚Üí Query rate card by instrument type
3. **Implement scenario generator** ‚Üí Use data to build optimized capital stacks
4. **Validate with real cases** ‚Üí Test against known film financing structures

## Maintenance

**Update Frequency:** Quarterly recommended, annually minimum

**Watch for:**
- Budget announcements (usually Q4/Q1 of each fiscal year)
