## Recommended Usage

### In the Navigator Model

These data files are designed to:

5. **Generate scenario comparisons** ‚Üí Compare different jurisdictional strategies

### Next Steps for Integration

1. **Create policy loader utility** ‚Üí Parse JSON ‚Üí IncentivePolicy Pydantic objects
2. **Build parameter lookup service** ‚Üí Query rate card by instrument type
3. **Implement scenario generator** ‚Üí Use data to build optimized capital stacks
