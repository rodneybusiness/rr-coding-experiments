  "notes": "The Scéal Uplift was introduced in October 2024 to support mid-to-lower budget Irish feature films. For animated features specifically, qualification requires that at least one of three key creative roles (Art Director, Composer, Production Designer) be filled by an Irish or EEA national/resident. This enhanced rate brings Ireland's credit to 40% (32% base + 8% uplift), making it highly competitive for animation features under €20M budget. Projects over €20M revert to the standard 32% Section 481 rate."
