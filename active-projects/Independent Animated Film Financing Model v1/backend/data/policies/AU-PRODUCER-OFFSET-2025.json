Short-form animation and TV animation receive the 30% rate. The offset is refundable - if the offset exceeds the company's tax liability, the excess is refunded. Can be combined with state/territory incentives and the PDV Offset for post/VFX work. Minimum QAPE of AUD $500,000 required. Must meet Significant Australian Content test. Administered by Screen Australia and the Australian Tax Office."
