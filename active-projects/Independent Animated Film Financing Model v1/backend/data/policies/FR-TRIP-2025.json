  "notes": "TRIP is administered by CNC (Centre national du cinéma et de l'image animée). Designed for international productions serviced in France. 30% base rate on French qualifying expenditures. Enhanced 40% rate for VFX-intensive projects (over €2M French VFX spend). Maximum €30M rebate per project. Animation-specific cultural test required. Eligible formats: feature films (live action or animation), TV series, web series, VR, short films, TV specials. Animation productions have lower minimum spend (€250k vs higher for live-action). France is a major European animation hub (e.g., Illumination Mac Guff). TRIP is separate from CNC's automatic aid system (which is for French/European co-productions). Processing time approximately 11 months. Rebate paid directly to French service company, which typically passes through to foreign producer via reduced invoice. Very competitive for animation due to strong infrastructure and talent pool in France."
