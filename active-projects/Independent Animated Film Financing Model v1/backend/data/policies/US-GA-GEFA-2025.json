  "notes": "Administered by Georgia Department of Revenue and the Georgia Film, Music & Digital Entertainment Office. Georgia's incentive is transferable, allowing production companies to sell credits on the secondary market. Current market rates: credits typically sell for $0.89-$0.925 per $1.00 of credit (10-11% discount). By law, credits must be sold for minimum 60% of face value. The 10% promotional uplift requires: (1) embedding the Georgia peach logo in the project's credits, and (2) using Georgia logo in marketing materials. With the 30% rate and typical 10% transfer discount, net effective benefit is approximately 27% of Georgia spend. The credit is taxable as federal income, reducing net benefit by ~5.7% for corporate taxpayers (21% federal rate applied to 27% net). Final effective rate: ~21.3% after all costs. Animation, gaming, and digital entertainment projects are explicitly eligible. No annual program cap makes Georgia highly competitive for large productions."
