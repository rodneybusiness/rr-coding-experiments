  "notes": "KOFIC (Korean Film Council) administers the location incentive for foreign productions. Two rate tiers: 20% rebate for 5+ day shoot with minimum KRW 100 million (approx USD $75k) qualified spend, OR 25% rebate for 10+ day shoot with minimum KRW 800 million (approx USD $600k) qualified spend. Cap of KRW 200 million (approx USD $150k) per project on the rebate amount. Must be at least 80% foreign-financed. Eligible for feature films, TV series, documentaries, and animation. South Korea has a growing animation industry with strong technical capabilities and cost-competitive labor. The per-project cap limits the incentive's value for very large productions, making it most attractive for mid-budget projects. Cash rebate paid after completion. Seoul Film Commission and regional film commissions also offer additional location support and services. Note: This is separate from domestic Korean production tax credits (5-15% for Korean companies producing content)."
