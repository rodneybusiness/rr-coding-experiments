Updated July 2023 to simplify the 5% uplift eligibility - previously complex PDV threshold, now more accessible. International animation projects fully eligible. New Zealand renowned for high-quality VFX and animation work (Weta Digital, now Weta FX). The 20-25% rebate is competitive for high-budget international animations requiring world-class post/VFX. Cash-based rebate, not tax offset. Administered by New Zealand Film Commission. Processing ~6 months. Can be attractive for animations with significant CGI/VFX component. Updates to criteria effective July 1, 2025 continue to support international production attraction."
