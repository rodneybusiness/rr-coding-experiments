  "notes": "Administered by SODEC (Société de développement des entreprises culturelles) and Revenu Québec. The Quebec PSTC is designed for service productions (including foreign productions) and does not require Canadian content certification. For animation specifically, the effective rate structure is: (1) 20% on all qualified Quebec expenditures (labor + goods/services), PLUS (2) additional 16% on computer-aided animation labor costs, for a combined 36% on animation labor. This makes Quebec one of the most competitive jurisdictions globally for animation production. Can be stacked with federal PSTC (16%) for service productions, yielding a potential combined federal+provincial rate of ~52% on animation labor."
