  "notes": "The PDV Offset is specifically designed for post-production and VFX work, making it ideal for animation projects. 30% refundable credit on qualifying Australian PDV expenditure. Minimum AUD $500,000 in qualifying PDV spend required. Eligible formats include feature films, TV series, documentaries, reality, animation (both live-action and animated content). No cultural test required - can be used by international productions. Particularly valuable for CGI animation which is PDV-intensive. Can be stacked with state/territory incentives. Some Australian states offer additional incentives that can bring total support above 40%. The PDV Offset is one of three offsets under the Australian Screen Production Incentive. Refundable - excess over tax liability is paid in cash."
