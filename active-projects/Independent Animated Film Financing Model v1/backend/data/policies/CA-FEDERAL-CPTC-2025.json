For productions without Canadian content (service productions), see the Canadian Film or Video Production Services Tax Credit (PSTC Federal) which offers 16%. Canadian content certification requires meeting cultural test (minimum 6/10 points) and having key Canadian creative positions. Animation productions are fully eligible and follow the same requirements as live-action. Can be stacked with provincial/territorial credits."
