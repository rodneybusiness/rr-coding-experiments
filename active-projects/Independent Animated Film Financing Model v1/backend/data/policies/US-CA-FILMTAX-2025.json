  "notes": "Program 4.0 represents a major expansion from Program 3.0. Key changes effective July 1, 2025: (1) Base rate increased from 20% to 35%, (2) Refundability extended to all qualified productions (previously non-refundable), (3) Animation explicitly included for first time ($1M+ budget), (4) Annual program budget increased to $750M (from $330M), (5) Additional 5% uplift available for productions outside LA County (total 40%). The program runs through June 30, 2030. Allocation is competitive via application process administered by California Film Commission. The 35-40% refundable rate makes California newly competitive with other major animation hubs. Credits are taxable as federal income (21% corporate rate), yielding net effective benefit of approximately 27.65-31.6% (35% rate) or 31.6-36.4% (40% rate with LA County uplift) after federal tax. Being refundable dramatically improves cash flow compared to prior non-refundable structure. Major policy shift to retain animation production in California."
