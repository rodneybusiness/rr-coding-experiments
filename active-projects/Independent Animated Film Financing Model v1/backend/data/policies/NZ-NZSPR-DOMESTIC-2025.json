  "notes": "The New Zealand Screen Production Rebate (NZSPR) replaced the previous NZSPG (Screen Production Grant) system. For domestic New Zealand productions (including animation): 40% cash rebate on QNZPE. Animation is an eligible format and is treated equally with live-action. Updated criteria effective July 1, 2025. New Zealand has a strong animation industry history (Weta, LOTR trilogy VFX/animation). The 40% domestic rate is among the highest globally for qualifying domestic content. Rebate is cash-based, not a tax credit offset. Administered by the New Zealand Film Commission. No per-project or annual program caps. Processing typically 6 months from completion to payment. Can be combined with New Zealand regional incentives in some cases."
