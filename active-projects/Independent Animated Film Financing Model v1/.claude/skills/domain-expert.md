## Domain Knowledge

### Deal Types & Their Implications

#### Equity Investment
- **Financial**: Ownership %, premium (15-25%), backend participation
- **Control**: Board seats, voting rights, approval rights
- **Waterfall**: Priority 8-9 (after debt)
- **Key Terms**: Preferred vs common, liquidation preference

#### Pre-Sales / MGs
- **Financial**: Minimum Guarantee against territory value
- **Control**: Minimal (delivery specs only)
- **Waterfall**: Can be collateral for gap loans
- **Key Terms**: Overage split (50/50 typical), payment on delivery

#### Streamer License vs Original
- **License**: Fixed fee, producer owns IP, limited approvals
- **Original**: Cost-plus (15-25%), platform owns IP, full control
- **Key Insight**: Original = no backend but guaranteed return

#### Gap Financing
- **Financial**: 30-50% of unsold territory value, 11-15% interest
- **Control**: Collateral requirements, bank covenants
- **Prerequisite**: Requires 50%+ pre-sales typically

### Tax Incentives (Already Modeled)
- UK AVEC: 39% animation credit
- Ireland Section 481: 32-40%
- Canada: Federal + Provincial stacking (50%+)
- Key: Stacking rules, transfer discounts, timing

### Waterfall Mechanics
Standard priority:
1. Distribution fees (25-35%)
2. P&A recoupment
3. Sales agent commission (15-20%)
4. Senior debt
5. Gap/mezz debt
6. Tax credit loans
7. Equity recoupment
8. Equity premium
9. Producer fees
10. Backend participation
11. Net profits

### Control vs Ownership Distinction
- **Ownership**: Who owns the IP, revenue rights
- **Control**: Who approves decisions (creative, business)
- A producer can own 100% but have 0% control (if approvals granted)
- A streamer can have 0% ownership but 100% control (original deal)

### Key Clauses That Matter

#### MFN (Most Favored Nations)
- If future investor gets better terms, MFN holders get same
- Severely constrains future deal flexibility
- Often found in equity and output deals

#### Reversion Triggers
- Rights return to producer after X years or if not exploited
- Critical for long-term franchise value
- Standard: 10-15 years, performance-based

#### Cross-Collateralization
- Revenue from multiple properties pooled
- BAD for producers (success pays for failures)
- Avoid slate-level cross-coll if possible

## When Advising
1. Consider the strategic goal (ownership vs control vs cost)
2. Identify hidden tradeoffs in deal structures
3. Flag clauses that limit future optionality
4. Suggest alternatives that preserve value

## Common Mistakes to Catch
- Comparing deals only on IRR (ignoring control)
- Ignoring MFN implications on future deals
- Undervaluing reversion triggers
- Not accounting for sequel/derivative rights
- Confusing license (temporary) with buyout (permanent)
