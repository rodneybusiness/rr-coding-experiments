# Index Cards Project (2025)

This project is dedicated to creating and managing index card sets for use with spaced repetition systems like RemNote and Anki.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to streamline the process of taking datasets and converting them into well-formatted, easily parsable files for RemNote and Anki. We aim for high-quality output that looks great and is optimized for learning.

## Sub-Projects

This project is organized into several sub-projects, each focusing on a specific dataset or theme.

### Current Sub-Projects

- **Answers for my Kids**: The first sub-project, focused on creating a set of index cards to answer common questions from children.

## Project Structure

### Source Data

-   `Answers for my Kids/answers_for_my_kids.psv`: The source dataset for the "Answers for my Kids" sub-project. This is a pipe-separated value (PSV) file.

### Generated Data

-   `Answers for my Kids/answers_for_my_kids.csv`: A CSV file generated from the source data. This file can be directly imported into Anki or RemNote. It is generated by the `scripts/convert_to_csv.py` script.

### Scripts

-   `scripts/convert_to_csv.py`: A Python script to convert pipe-separated value (PSV) files into standard CSV format.
    -   **Usage**: `python scripts/convert_to_csv.py <input_file.psv> <output_file.csv>`

## Technical Goals

-   **Data Formatting**: Develop scripts and workflows to convert various data formats into optimal structures for RemNote and Anki.
-   **Automation**: Automate as much of the process as possible, from data ingestion to final output.
-   **Quality Assurance**: Implement checks and balances to ensure the quality and consistency of the index cards.
-   **Project Management**: Manage the entire project from within this GitHub repository.

## Getting Started

Each sub-project will have its own directory containing the relevant data, scripts, and documentation. See the individual sub-project folders for more details.
