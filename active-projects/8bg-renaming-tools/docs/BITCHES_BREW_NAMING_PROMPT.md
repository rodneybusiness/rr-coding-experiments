# üé∫ BITCHES BREW - PERFECT NAMING CONVENTION APPLICATION PROMPT

## üéØ OBJECTIVE
Transform the Bitches Brew project folder into a brilliantly organized system using the proven 8BG/Burnt naming convention, anticipating and solving all potential issues before they arise.

## üìã CORE NAMING FORMAT
`[STAGE]-[SUBCATEGORY]_[PROJECT]_[DESCRIPTOR]_[VERSION]-[INITIALS]_[DATE](-[TIME]).[EXT]`

Where PROJECT = "BB" (Bitches Brew abbreviated for cleaner filenames)

## üîç PRE-ANALYSIS CHECKLIST
Before renaming ANY file:

1. **List all files** in the Bitches Brew folder
2. **Check file dates** (created/modified) to establish chronology
3. **Identify file relationships** (which PDFs match which FDX files)
4. **Spot naming patterns** (RR's existing conventions)
5. **Note special cases** (corrupted files, alternates, partials)

## üìä STAGE ASSIGNMENT LOGIC

### STAGE 00-INFO
Look for: Character lists, project bibles, cast wishlists, general info
- Keywords: "overview", "characters", "bible", "info"

### STAGE 01-NOTES
**Subcategories:**
- **DEVELOPMENT**: Early ideas, concepts, pitches
- **PERSONAL**: RR's private thoughts, musings
- **FEEDBACK**: Studio/producer notes, reader coverage
- **MEETING**: Meeting transcripts, call notes
- **RESEARCH**: Reference materials, comp scripts, jazz history

Look for: Notes, thoughts, research, feedback, meetings
- Keywords: "notes", "thoughts", "ideas", "feedback", "meeting"

### STAGE 02-BEATSHEET
Look for: Outlines, structure docs, beat-by-beat breakdowns
- Keywords: "beats", "outline", "structure", "beatsheet"

### STAGE 03-TREATMENT
Look for: Official treatments, scriptments, pitch documents
- Keywords: "treatment", "scriptment", "pitch"

### STAGE 04-VOMDRAFT
Look for: First rough drafts, "vomit" drafts
- Keywords: "vomit", "rough", "first draft"

### STAGE 05-DRAFT
Look for: Working scripts, revisions, polishes
- Keywords: "draft", "revision", "rewrite", "polish"

### STAGE 06-OFFICIAL
Look for: Studio submissions, "official" versions
- Keywords: "official", "submission", "studio"

### STAGE 07-FINAL
Look for: Locked scripts, production drafts
- Keywords: "final", "locked", "production"

## üö® ANTICIPATED ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: Ambiguous File Names
**Example**: "Bitches Brew Draft.fdx"
**Solution**: 
1. Check file date to determine version number
2. Look for matching PDF to verify content
3. Open file briefly to check page count/content
4. Default to 05-DRAFT if unclear

### Issue 2: Version Number Confusion
**Example**: Multiple files from same date
**Solution**:
1. Check modification times (use hours/minutes)
2. Look for iterative saves (424PM, 425PM, 426PM)
3. Check file sizes (later versions usually larger)
4. When in doubt, use v01a, v01b, v01c for same-day versions

### Issue 3: Missing Dates
**Example**: "Bitches Brew Outline.pages"
**Solution**:
1. Use file creation date from get_file_info
2. If creation date seems wrong, use last modified
3. Format as YYMMDD (250625 for June 25, 2025)

### Issue 4: Unclear Collaborators
**Example**: "Bitches Brew Revised Draft.fdx"
**Solution**:
1. Default to "-RR" if no other initials present
2. Look for "SK", "MM" or other collaborator patterns
3. Check if file name contains "SKRR" or similar
4. When unknown, omit initials rather than guess

### Issue 5: Jazz/Music Specific Content
**Example**: "Miles Davis Research.pdf"
**Solution**:
1. Use 01-NOTES-RESEARCH_BB_MilesDavisReference_v01_[DATE].pdf
2. Be specific: "JazzHistory", "MilesBiography", "AlbumAnalysis"
3. Keep music terminology when relevant

### Issue 6: Multiple Formats Same Content
**Example**: Draft.fdx, Draft.pdf, Draft-notes.pdf
**Solution**:
1. Keep same base name, add format identifier
2. 05-DRAFT_BB_SecondAct_v01_250625.fdx
3. 05-DRAFT_BB_SecondAct_v01_250625.pdf
4. 05-DRAFT_BB_SecondAct_v01_250625-notes.pdf

## üéØ DESCRIPTOR BEST PRACTICES

### BE SPECIFIC
‚ùå "Draft" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "FirstActRevision"
‚ùå "Notes" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "CharacterArcs"
‚ùå "Revision" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "DialoguePolish"
‚ùå "New" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "StudioNotes-Applied"

### JAZZ/MUSIC DESCRIPTORS
- "OpeningSet" (instead of "Opening")
- "ImprovisationScene" (for jazz sequences)
- "StudioSession" (for recording scenes)
- "NightclubSequence" (for performance scenes)

## üìù SPECIAL SUFFIXES

Standard suffixes to use:
- `-unused` ‚Üí Abandoned versions
- `-partial` ‚Üí Incomplete drafts  
- `-corrupt` ‚Üí Damaged files
- `-alt` ‚Üí Alternative approach
- `-notes` ‚Üí Has annotations
- `-clean` ‚Üí No annotations
- `-formatted` ‚Üí Properly formatted
- `-raw` ‚Üí Unformatted
- `-FD12` ‚Üí Final Draft 12
- `-425PM` ‚Üí RR's time format (not 1625)

## üîÑ EXECUTION WORKFLOW

1. **Create backup first**: Copy entire folder before starting
2. **Create tracking log**: Document every rename
3. **Test pattern**: Rename 3-5 files first, verify pattern works
4. **Batch by stage**: Do all 01-NOTES files, then 02-BEATSHEET, etc.
5. **Verify relationships**: Ensure FDX/PDF pairs stay matched
6. **Final review**: List directory and check consistency

## ‚úÖ QUALITY CHECKS

After renaming, verify:
1. **Chronological order** makes sense when sorted by name
2. **Version progression** is logical (v01 ‚Üí v02 ‚Üí v03)
3. **No duplicate names** exist
4. **All files accounted for** (count before = count after)
5. **Special characters** handled (√© in "caf√©" scenes)

## üé∫ JAZZ-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

Given this is "Bitches Brew":
1. May have music cues, song lists ‚Üí 00-INFO_BB_MusicCues_v01_[DATE]
2. Historical research ‚Üí 01-NOTES-RESEARCH_BB_JazzHistory1969_v01_[DATE]
3. Studio session beats ‚Üí 02-BEATSHEET_BB_RecordingSession_v01_[DATE]
4. Character names might be musicians ‚Üí Keep as-is in descriptors

## üí° FINAL WISDOM

- **When in doubt, be descriptive** rather than vague
- **Preserve RR's intent** - if he called it "vomit draft", keep that spirit
- **Think like a future reader** - will someone understand this in 2 years?
- **Stay consistent** - once you choose a pattern, stick to it
- **Document edge cases** - note any unusual decisions in the log

## üöÄ SUCCESS METRICS

You'll know you've succeeded when:
1. Any file can be found in under 5 seconds
2. The creative evolution is visible at a glance
3. Version history is crystal clear
4. Collaborations are documented
5. The folder tells the story of the project

Remember: This isn't just organizing files - it's preserving the creative journey of a project named after one of the most innovative jazz albums ever recorded. Make Miles proud! üé∫‚ú®
